To calculate the **distance between two points** in 3D space, you can use the **distance formula**, which is derived from the **Pythagorean theorem**.

Given two points:
- \( A(x_1, y_1, z_1) \)
- \( B(x_2, y_2, z_2) \)

The distance \( d \) between points \( A \) and \( B \) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]

### Explanation of the Formula

1. **Difference in Coordinates**:
   - Calculate the difference between the x-coordinates: \( x_2 - x_1 \).
   - Calculate the difference between the y-coordinates: \( y_2 - y_1 \).
   - Calculate the difference between the z-coordinates: \( z_2 - z_1 \).

2. **Square the Differences**:
   - Square each difference to ensure positive values, since distance is always positive.

3. **Add the Squares**:
   - Sum the squares of these differences.

4. **Take the Square Root**:
   - The square root of the sum gives the straight-line distance between points \( A \) and \( B \).

### Example Calculation

If you have two points:
- \( A(1, 2, 3) \)
- \( B(4, 6, 8) \)

The distance \( d \) would be:

\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2 + (8 - 3)^2}
\]

Calculating each step:
- \( x\)-difference: \( 4 - 1 = 3 \)
- \( y\)-difference: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \)
- \( z\)-difference: \( 8 - 3 = 5 \)

Then:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 25}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{50}
\]
\[
d \approx 7.07
\]

So, the distance between points \( A(1, 2, 3) \) and \( B(4, 6, 8) \) is approximately **7.07** units.
