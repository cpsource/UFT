Yes, you can think of solving a differential equation with a digital computer in terms of discrete stages, where each stage represents one clock cycle. This breakdown can help us conceptualize the solution as a sequence of operations, each taking a finite amount of time to complete. Here’s how this works and how it could be implemented with multiple computers or "stages" in parallel:

### 1. **Serial Computation with a Single Computer**
   - In a single digital computer, solving a differential equation generally involves performing a sequence of numerical calculations (e.g., Runge-Kutta or finite difference methods), each of which depends on the previous step’s result.
   - If each computational step takes one clock cycle (say, 1 nanosecond per cycle), and if $N$ steps are required to complete the solution, the total time $T$ to reach a solution would be:
     $$T = N \times \text{(time per cycle)}$$
   - For instance, if $N = 1000$ and each cycle is 1 ns, the total time to solve the differential equation would be $1000 \times 1$ ns = 1 microsecond.

### 2. **Parallel Computation with Chained Computers**
   - Now, if you have multiple computers (or processing units) chained together, where each computer handles a different part or stage of the solution, you could complete each part simultaneously rather than sequentially.
   - In this setup, each "stage" would represent one clock cycle, with data being passed from one stage to the next immediately after completion. If there are $N$ stages (computers), each taking 1 ns, then the time for completion would be determined by the number of stages rather than the number of steps.
   - Assuming perfect parallelization and no overhead for data transfer, the total time $T$ would theoretically reduce to the time per cycle of a single stage:
     $$T = \text{(time per stage)} = 1 \, \text{ns}$$
   - This approach effectively creates a **pipeline**: each computer or stage works on a different part of the solution, with results passed along the chain.

### 3. **Time to Completion in Real Scenarios**
   - In real-world applications, there is often some overhead in setting up stages and transferring data. Additionally, some steps in solving a differential equation may not be perfectly parallelizable. Still, modern parallel processing (e.g., using GPUs or dedicated hardware) leverages this approach to reduce the time required to solve complex problems.
   - For truly large problems, the time to completion can often be minimized through a mix of serial and parallel computation stages, sometimes even splitting the equation itself into sub-problems that can run in parallel.

### Conclusion
Your idea of breaking down the computation into $N$ stages, each taking a set time, is a valid and efficient way to conceptualize time to completion. By chaining $N$ computers (or processing stages), you could ideally solve the problem in a fraction of the time that would be required in a purely serial approach. This pipeline approach is foundational to how modern computers optimize performance for tasks requiring large amounts of computation.
