Question:

Now, lets use the physics definition of energy, to describe the total energy in each group. So that we can compare, should we use electron-volts, or whatever you decide. But use the same measure once you settle on it. For example, an atom contains some energy, but an elephant is made up of atoms, therefore, its total energy is mass times atom energy.

Answer:

To describe the total energy at each group level, we'll use the physics definition of **energy**, which encompasses various forms like kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, and rest energy (related to mass via $E = mc^2$). For consistency, we’ll express energy in **electron volts (eV)**, a convenient unit for atomic and molecular scales that can also be scaled up.

The total energy in each group increases with the scale, as each level incorporates the energy from components at smaller scales. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Quantum Realm (10⁻³⁵ to 10⁻¹⁰ meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: Single particles, such as electrons and quarks, have energies typically measured in **MeV (mega-electron volts, $10^6$ eV)**.
- **Example**:
  - An electron’s rest energy is ~0.511 MeV.
  - A proton’s rest energy is ~938 MeV.
- **Total Energy in Group**: **1 MeV to 1 GeV** (1 billion eV) for systems involving a few fundamental particles, like an atom’s nucleus.

### 2. **Molecular and Cellular Biology (10⁻⁹ to 10⁻⁵ meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: Molecules in biological systems have binding energies on the order of **eV to keV (kilo-electron volts, $10^3$ eV)**.
- **Example**:
  - Covalent bonds between atoms: ~1-10 eV per bond.
  - Typical energy content of a small molecule like ATP: ~30-40 kJ/mol (~0.25 eV per molecule).
  - For a single human cell (~$10^{10}$ molecules): ~$10^9$ eV to $10^{12}$ eV (based on cumulative molecular energy).
- **Total Energy in Group**: **$10^9$ eV to $10^{12}$ eV** for small to large biological molecules in a single cell.

### 3. **Human Scale and Macroscopic Biology (10⁰ to 10² meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: For macroscopic organisms like humans, the total energy is the sum of all molecular and cellular energies.
- **Example**:
  - The average human (~70 kg) has a rest energy of $E = mc^2$, which is ~$6.3 \times 10^{21}$ eV (or ~600 MJ).
  - This includes the energy from trillions of cells, each with a few trillion eV in molecular binding energy.
- **Total Energy in Group**: **~$10^{21}$ eV** for an average human, dominated by the mass-energy equivalent of atomic particles within their body.

### 4. **Geological and Terrestrial Scale (10⁴ to 10⁷ meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: This scale involves the mass-energy of Earth’s biosphere, atmosphere, and physical structure.
- **Example**:
  - Mass-energy of Earth’s crust (for a 1 km³ volume of rock ~2.7 billion metric tons): ~$2.5 \times 10^{33}$ eV.
  - Earth’s total mass-energy (for ~$6 \times 10^{24}$ kg): ~$5.4 \times 10^{41}$ eV.
- **Total Energy in Group**: **~$10^{41}$ eV**, dominated by the gravitational binding energy and mass-energy of Earth.

  - Energy generated by fusion in the Sun: ~$10^{26}$ watts (~$6.24 \times 10^{37}$ eV/s).
- **Total Energy in Group**: **~$10^{47}$ eV** for an average star like the Sun, dominated by mass-energy and fusion energy.

### 6. **Solar System and Interstellar Scale (10¹² to 10¹⁶ meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: The total energy in a solar system includes the mass-energy of the Sun and planets, gravitational potential energy, and contributions from interstellar matter.
- **Example**:
  - Mass-energy of the Sun and planets: ~$10^{47}$ eV.
  - Gravitational binding energy of the solar system: ~$10^{42}$ eV.
  - Kinetic energy of orbiting bodies: ~$10^{42}$ eV (cumulative for planets).
- **Total Energy in Group**: **~$10^{47}$ eV to $10^{48}$ eV**, with most energy stored in the Sun’s mass-energy and fusion.

### 7. **Galactic and Intergalactic Scale (10¹⁶ to 10²³ meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: Galaxies contain hundreds of billions of stars, dark matter, and vast gravitational energy.
- **Example**:
  - Mass-energy of the Milky Way (10¹² solar masses): ~$10^{57}$ eV.
  - Dark matter contribution (estimated 5x visible mass): ~$5 \times 10^{57}$ eV.
  - Gravitational binding energy of the Milky Way: ~$10^{56}$ eV.

### 8. **Cosmic and Universal Scale (10²³ to 10²⁷ meters)**

- **Typical Energy Scale**: The observable universe contains mass-energy from all galaxies, dark matter, and the influence of dark energy.

  - Dark energy contribution (estimated to be about 70% of total): ~$7 \times 10^{68}$ eV.
  - Cosmic background radiation energy: ~$10^{65}$ eV.
- **Total Energy in Group**: **~$10^{69}$ eV**, with dark energy and mass-energy of galaxies as the major components.
