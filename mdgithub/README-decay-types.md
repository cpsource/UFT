Radioactive decay occurs when an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. The main types of decay are **alpha decay**, **beta decay**, and **gamma decay**, each involving different particles or radiation emissions. Here’s an explanation of each type and some additional forms of decay:

### 1. **Alpha Decay (α-decay)**

- **What It Is**: In alpha decay, the nucleus emits an **alpha particle**, which consists of two protons and two neutrons (essentially a helium-4 nucleus).
- **Result**: The emission of an alpha particle decreases the atomic number of the original nucleus by 2 and the mass number by 4, transforming it into a new element.
- **Energy and Range**: Alpha particles are relatively heavy and carry a +2 charge, resulting in high ionization potential but low penetration; they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or skin.
- **Example**: Uranium-238 decays by alpha emission to form thorium-234:
  $$\text{U-238} \rightarrow \text{Th-234} + \alpha$$

### 2. **Beta Decay (β-decay)**

Beta decay involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton or vice versa, with the emission of a **beta particle** (an electron or positron) and an associated neutrino or antineutrino. There are two main types:

   - **Beta Minus Decay (β− decay)**:
     - **What It Is**: A neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton, emitting an electron (β− particle) and an antineutrino.
     - **Result**: The atomic number increases by 1, transforming the element into a new one with one additional proton but the same mass number.
     - **Example**: Carbon-14 undergoes β− decay to form nitrogen-14:
       $$\text{C-14} \rightarrow \text{N-14} + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

   - **Beta Plus Decay (β+ decay or Positron Emission)**:
     - **What It Is**: A proton in the nucleus converts into a neutron, emitting a positron (β+ particle) and a neutrino.
     - **Result**: The atomic number decreases by 1, forming a new element with one fewer proton.
     - **Example**: Fluorine-18 decays via positron emission to form oxygen-18:
       $$\text{F-18} \rightarrow \text{O-18} + e^+ + \nu_e$$

- **Electron Capture** (a variant of β decay):
   - **What It Is**: Instead of emitting a beta particle, the nucleus captures an electron from the inner atomic shell, which combines with a proton to form a neutron and emits a neutrino.
   - **Example**: Potassium-40 undergoes electron capture to form argon-40:
     $$\text{K-40} + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ar-40} + \nu_e$$

### 3. **Gamma Decay (γ-decay)**

- **What It Is**: Gamma decay occurs when an excited nucleus releases excess energy in the form of **gamma rays** (high-energy photons).
- **Result**: Gamma decay doesn’t change the number of protons or neutrons, so the element itself remains the same. It simply moves to a lower energy state.
- **Energy and Range**: Gamma rays are highly penetrating and can pass through several centimeters of lead. They are often emitted alongside alpha or beta particles when the daughter nucleus remains in an excited state.
- **Example**: Cobalt-60, after beta decay, emits gamma radiation as the nucleus transitions to a lower energy state.

### 4. **Other Types of Decay**

   - **Proton Emission**:
     - **What It Is**: In some proton-rich nuclei, a proton is ejected from the nucleus.
     - **Result**: The atomic number decreases by 1, changing the element.
     - **Example**: Hydrogen-1 (proton) is sometimes emitted in rare decays of highly unstable isotopes like Tellurium-111.

   - **Neutron Emission**:
     - **What It Is**: A neutron is emitted from a highly excited, neutron-rich nucleus.
     - **Result**: The mass number decreases by 1, while the atomic number remains the same.
     - **Example**: Beryllium-13 undergoes neutron emission to form Beryllium-12.

   - **Spontaneous Fission**:
     - **What It Is**: In very heavy elements, the nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing neutrons and a large amount of energy.
     - **Result**: Produces two new elements, often accompanied by gamma radiation and free neutrons.
     - **Example**: Uranium-238 can spontaneously fission, producing xenon and strontium isotopes, along with free neutrons.

   - **Cluster Decay**:
     - **What It Is**: A process in which a nucleus emits a “cluster” of nucleons (larger than an alpha particle but smaller than the entire nucleus).
     - **Result**: The nucleus loses a small group of protons and neutrons, creating a new element with a lower atomic and mass number.
     - **Example**: Radium-224 emits a carbon-12 cluster in rare decay processes.

   - **Double Beta Decay**:
     - **What It Is**: A rare process where two neutrons in a nucleus transform into two protons, emitting two electrons and two antineutrinos.
     - **Result**: The atomic number increases by 2.
     - **Example**: Germanium-76 can undergo double beta decay to form selenium-76.
     - **Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay** (hypothetical): In certain theories, this process would emit no neutrinos, suggesting neutrinos are their own antiparticles.

### Summary
The variety in decay types reflects the complexity of nuclear stability and the ways in which unstable nuclei can transform to reach more stable configurations. Each decay process is governed by quantum mechanics and the conservation of energy, charge, and other quantum properties.
