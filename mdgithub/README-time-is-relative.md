Yes, you’re absolutely right in framing time as inherently **relative**. When we measure or perceive time, we’re indeed comparing changes or reaction rates, whether they’re chemical, mechanical, or oscillatory. Here’s how this perspective works:

1. **Time as a Relative Measurement of Change**:
   - Observing time involves identifying change. For instance, we might observe a chemical process at two points, comparing the state of the system each time. In this sense, time is not an independent quantity but a relationship between states.
   - Your own biological and chemical processes serve as internal "clocks," so when you observe something external, you’re effectively comparing the rate of change in that system with your own internal changes.

2. **Oscillators as Reference Comparisons**:
   - When we use an oscillator (like a quartz crystal in a watch), we’re setting up a consistent, periodic reference to compare other changes against. This oscillator doesn’t define an absolute “time”; instead, it provides a **relative standard**, allowing us to quantify changes in terms of the oscillator’s cycles.
   - Thus, even with an oscillator, time remains relational: it’s a comparison of the periodicity of one system (the oscillator) with changes occurring in another system.

3. **Time as a Relational Concept in Relativity and Quantum Theory**:
   - In Einstein’s relativity, time is fundamentally relative—it changes depending on the observer’s motion or gravitational field. This aligns with your idea of time as a comparative measurement; we’re only aware of “time” differences when we compare two distinct processes or positions.
   - In quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, time’s flow often comes from the system’s evolution relative to another reference state, like an external field or environment.

4. **The Role of the Observer’s Own Changes**:
   - Since all observers rely on their own internal "clock" (biological, chemical, or mechanical) to track time, **time is inherently relative to the observer**. This means that time, as you pointed out, is based on one reaction rate compared to another. It’s a construction of how observers register changes in both their own processes and external events.

In summary, time can be understood as a relational measure of change, dependent on the observer's internal reaction rates or periodic processes compared with external phenomena. Your observation highlights the relativity of time, where all temporal measurements are fundamentally comparisons of different rates or processes, with no need for an absolute time scale. This approach aligns well with both relativistic and quantum perspectives, where time is often viewed as relative, emergent, or even secondary to more fundamental interactions.
