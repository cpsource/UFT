Incorporating your model into relativistic thinking could provide a wave-based perspective on why the speed of light, $c$, serves as the ultimate speed limit and how mass, inertia, and gravity interact at relativistic speeds. Here’s how this might work:

1. **Wave Propagation and the Speed Limit $c$**:
   - If mass is represented by self-emitted wave functions that interact with spacetime, these wave functions might propagate at the speed $c$ as a natural maximum. This aligns with relativity’s constraint, where any field-mediated effect (such as gravity or inertia in your model) cannot travel faster than $c$.
   - Since your model describes mass as a generator of wave functions, the limit $c$ could correspond to the propagation speed of these waves within spacetime. This would mean that the wave field’s effect (gravity or inertia) extends outward from mass at $c$, creating a boundary for interactions.

2. **Inertia as Wave Resistance at High Velocities**:
   - In your model, inertia arises from the self-interaction of the wave field emitted by mass. As velocity approaches $c$, the wave field would experience increased resistance to change. This resistance could be linked to the Lorentz factor $\gamma$, where, at high speeds, the wave structure “stiffens,” creating the effect we know as time dilation and length contraction.
   - The wave field would need increasingly higher energy to produce additional speed, effectively making it impossible to accelerate a particle with mass to $c$ due to the infinite energy requirement. This wave resistance could be a manifestation of the particle’s inertia intensifying with speed.

3. **Gravity Waves and the Causal Influence**:
   - If gravity in your model is the result of wave function emissions from mass, the propagation speed of these gravitational effects would naturally be limited to $c$. This matches the relativistic idea that changes in a gravitational field (such as gravitational waves) travel at $c$.
   - In this sense, the gravitational influence would represent the "reach" of mass’s wave field, spreading out through spacetime and obeying the same causal limits as other relativistic interactions.

4. **Photon Behavior and the Role of $c$**:
   - In your model, massless particles like photons could be viewed as pure wave emissions, traveling at the maximum wave propagation speed of $c$ because they lack the internal resistance (or inertia) associated with a mass-generating field. Therefore, they move at $c$ inherently, as they are direct expressions of the wave field without a localized mass.

5. **Time Dilation and Wave Structure**:
   - Since time dilation and length contraction are consequences of moving near $c$, they could be seen in your model as modifications of the emitted wave field’s structure. For an object moving close to $c$, the field’s ability to "keep up" with the object’s motion diminishes, leading to the relativistic effects we observe as time dilation (slowing down of the wave’s internal oscillations) and length contraction (compression of the wave field in the direction of motion).

### Summary
Incorporating your model into relativity could provide a unique wave-based explanation for why $c$ is the speed limit, linking it to the propagation speed of mass-emitted wave fields. The wave field’s resistance to change at high speeds would align with relativistic inertia, and the causal boundary imposed by $c$ could reflect the maximum reach of gravitational and inertial wave effects within spacetime. This approach aligns with both the wave properties of mass and the relativistic structure of spacetime, offering a new perspective on mass, inertia, and the constant $c$.
