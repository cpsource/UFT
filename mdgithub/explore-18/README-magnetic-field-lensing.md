Yes, magnetic fields, independent of light, can be influenced by **gravitational lensing** because gravity affects the fabric of spacetime itself, and magnetic fields are part of the electromagnetic field structure that exists within spacetime.

### **Why Magnetic Fields Are Affected**
1. **Spacetime Curvature**:
   - Magnetic fields exist as distortions or effects within spacetime.
   - In general relativity, massive objects like stars, galaxies, or black holes curve spacetime.
   - This curvature affects anything traveling through spacetime, including light, charged particles, and magnetic field lines.

2. **Magnetic Fields Are Part of the Electromagnetic Field**:
   - Maxwell's equations describe the interdependence of electric and magnetic fields.
   - In the presence of strong gravitational fields, the overall electromagnetic field (and therefore magnetic fields) will follow the curvature of spacetime.

### **Gravitational Influence on Magnetic Fields**
1. **Static Magnetic Fields**:
   - If a magnetic field is generated by a stationary source in curved spacetime (e.g., a magnetic field around a star or near a black hole), the field lines will follow the curvature of spacetime.
   - The field geometry may appear "bent" to an external observer due to spacetime warping.

2. **Dynamic Magnetic Fields**:
   - If the magnetic field is part of a propagating electromagnetic wave, its path will also bend under gravitational lensing.
   - For example, radio waves or other magnetic field components traveling near a massive object will experience lensing just like light.

### **Evidence and Observations**
1. **Astrophysical Magnetic Fields**:
   - Magnetic fields in space, such as those around stars, pulsars, or black holes, appear distorted due to gravitational effects.
   - For example, near a black hole, magnetic field lines may become twisted or dragged by the intense curvature of spacetime.

2. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**:
   - The CMB contains information about early magnetic fields in the universe.
   - The lensing of the CMB by massive structures could indirectly show how magnetic fields are influenced by gravitational lensing.

3. **Relativistic Effects**:
   - Observations of magnetars (highly magnetized neutron stars) and the magnetic fields near black holes provide indirect evidence that magnetic fields are affected by gravity.

### **Theoretical Framework**
In general relativity:
- The magnetic field is represented as part of the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor, which interacts with the curvature of spacetime.
- The geodesic equations that describe the path of light also apply to other field lines, including magnetic ones, meaning they follow the same curvature.

In **UFT-NN**:
- Magnetic fields could be seen as distortions in sub-space that align with the underlying energy wells created by mass and gravity.
- Gravitational lensing could then distort these sub-space fields, bending the associated magnetic field lines.

### **Predictions**
1. **Field Line Curvature**:
   - Near massive objects, magnetic field lines should curve more steeply, corresponding to the gravitational curvature.
2. **Field Strength Variations**:
   - The strength of magnetic fields might amplify or diminish in regions of stronger gravitational lensing due to field line concentration.
3. **Observable Effects**:
   - Gravitational lensing of polarized radio waves (synchrotron radiation) could provide clues about how magnetic fields behave near massive objects.

---

### **Conclusion**
Magnetic fields, independent of light, follow gravitational lensing because they are embedded in spacetime, which is curved by gravity. This phenomenon has observable astrophysical consequences and aligns with predictions from both general relativity and UFT-NN, providing a unified way to understand how gravity influences magnetic phenomena.
