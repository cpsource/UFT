This is an intriguing setup! Observer $P_2$, using only a wire and its ability to measure voltage, faces challenges in distinguishing the fields generated by $P_1$, especially without knowledge of $P_1$'s distance or motion. Let’s break it down systematically.

---

### **1. Fields Observed at $P_2$**
- **Electric Field ($\vec{E}$)**:
  - If $P_1$ is charged, $P_2$ may detect an electric field. The direction of $\vec{E}$ will point radially away (positive charge) or toward $P_1$ (negative charge).
  
- **Magnetic Field ($\vec{B}$)**:
  - If $P_1$ is moving or generates a current, $P_2$ might detect a magnetic field. The direction of $\vec{B}$ follows the right-hand rule, based on the motion or current at $P_1$.

- **Combined Effects**:
  - $P_2$’s wire could detect the **induced voltage** resulting from:
    1. $\vec{E}$: Static or dynamic electric fields.
    2. $\vec{B}$: Dynamic magnetic fields that induce an electric field due to Faraday’s law of induction.

### **2. Measuring Voltage Across the Wire**
#### **A. Electric Field-Induced Voltage**
- A static or oscillating electric field ($\vec{E}$) at $P_2$ could induce a voltage ($V$) across the wire:
  $$V = \int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl}$$
  where $\vec{dl}$ is the length of the wire.

- The polarity of the voltage depends on the orientation of the wire relative to $\vec{E}$.

#### **B. Magnetic Field-Induced Voltage**
- A **time-varying magnetic field** ($\vec{B}$) at $P_2$ induces an electric field ($\vec{E}_{\text{induced}}$) around the wire via Faraday’s law:
  $$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$
- The voltage induced in the wire is given by:
  $$V = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$
  where $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux through the loop formed by the wire.

#### **C. Distinguishing $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$**
- If the measured voltage:
  - **Varies with time**: Likely due to $\vec{B}$, as a changing magnetic field induces a voltage.
  - **Is constant**: Likely due to $\vec{E}$, as a static electric field induces a steady potential difference.

### **3. Effects of $P_1$’s Motion on $P_2$**
If $P_1$ is moving relative to $P_2$, two key effects arise:
#### **A. Doppler Effect**
- A moving $P_1$ emitting time-varying fields would shift the frequency of the observed signals at $P_2$:
  $$f_{\text{observed}} = f_{\text{emitted}} \frac{c}{c \pm v}$$
  where $v$ is the relative velocity between $P_1$ and $P_2$.

#### **B. Relativistic Transformation of Fields**
- In $P_2$’s frame, a moving $P_1$ with charge generates both:
  1. **Electric Field ($\vec{E}$)**: The primary field from the charge.
  2. **Magnetic Field ($\vec{B}$)**: Due to the motion of the charge.
  
  The transformation of fields is given by:
  $$\vec{B} = \frac{\vec{v} \times \vec{E}}{c^2}$$
  Thus, $\vec{B}$ arises from the relative velocity ($\vec{v}$) and the electric field ($\vec{E}$).

### **4. Detecting Motion Without Moving the Wire**
Without moving the wire, $P_2$ could infer $P_1$’s motion indirectly:
1. **Field Variations**:
   - Time-varying voltage across the wire suggests dynamic fields, possibly due to $P_1$’s motion.

2. **Field Asymmetry**:
   - If $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are detected simultaneously, their relative orientations and magnitudes could indicate motion.

3. **Polarization of the Fields**:
   - The directionality of the voltage across the wire (e.g., polarity shifts over time) may indicate $P_1$’s direction of motion.

---

### **5. Challenges Without Distance Knowledge**
Since $P_2$ doesn’t know the distance to $P_1$:
- The falloff rate ($1/r^3$) cannot be used to distinguish between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$.
- Field measurements alone would not provide absolute information about $P_1$’s distance but can provide relative motion data.

---

### **Summary**
- $P_2$ detects voltage across the wire due to the electric ($\vec{E}$) or magnetic ($\vec{B}$) field generated by $P_1$.
- A static voltage suggests $\vec{E}$; a time-varying voltage suggests $\vec{B}$ or relative motion.
- Doppler shifts or relativistic transformations of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ provide indirect evidence of $P_1$’s motion.
- Inferring $P_1$’s motion or distance is challenging without additional data, but careful measurements of field behavior at $P_2$ can reveal relative dynamics.
