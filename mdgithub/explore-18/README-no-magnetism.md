Your thought experiment is an interesting proposal: reinterpreting **electromagnetic phenomena** not as two distinct fields ($\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$) but as a **unified stream of information** that encodes the necessary relationships. Let's break this down and explore its implications.

---

### **1. Eliminating Magnetism as a Fundamental Entity**
#### **Current View**:
- In classical electromagnetism, magnetism arises naturally from moving charges or changing electric fields.
- Maxwell's equations describe this interaction mathematically:
  - $\vec{E}$ induces $\vec{B}$, and $\vec{B}$ induces $\vec{E}$.

#### **Your Hypothesis**:
- Magnetism is not a distinct physical phenomenon but a consequence of how charge motion is perceived.
- It’s a **derived effect**, like the mathematical utility of imaginary numbers, helpful but not a "real" physical entity.

---

### **2. Using Information Theory for Communication Between $P_1$ and $P_2$**
#### **Information Transmission**:
- A charge at $P_1$, moving or accelerating, sends out **information about its state** to $P_2$.
- The information encodes:
  1. **Charge Properties**: Magnitude, sign.
  2. **Position and Motion**: Velocity, acceleration.

#### **No Redundant Communication**:
- Maxwell's equations encode electric and magnetic fields as separate entities.
- Your proposal simplifies this:
  - The information sent from $P_1$ to $P_2$ describes the charge and its state once.
  - $P_2$ reconstructs the electromagnetic behavior locally using mathematical relationships.

---

### **3. Implications for Observations at $P_2$**
#### **Current Understanding**:
- $P_2$ directly observes $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$.
- The interplay of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ governs electromagnetic waves and interactions.

#### **Your Hypothesis**:
- $P_2$ observes only one unified signal from $P_1$, which encodes:
  - Electric field effects ($\vec{E}$).
  - Magnetic field effects ($\vec{B}$) as secondary derivatives or relationships.

- Maxwell’s equations are then mathematical transformations applied at $P_2$ to derive:
  $$\vec{B} = \frac{\vec{v} \times \vec{E}}{c^2}, \quad \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}, \quad \text{etc.}$$

---

### **4. Advantages of This Model**
#### **Efficiency**:
- Information is sent once, reducing redundancy.
- $P_2$ reconstructs magnetism locally rather than receiving "magnetism information" directly.

#### **Unification**:
- The distinction between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ dissolves into a single informational framework.
- This aligns with relativistic views, where electric and magnetic fields are unified as components of the electromagnetic tensor.

---

### **5. Reconciling with Maxwell's Equations**
Maxwell’s equations are phenomenologically accurate but could be viewed as:
- **Transformations**: Mathematical tricks that allow $P_2$ to infer magnetic effects ($\vec{B}$) from the electric effects ($\vec{E}$) and charge motion.
- **Relativistic Relations**: $\vec{B}$ emerges naturally from $\vec{E}$ in different reference frames, suggesting it is not a separate phenomenon but a perspective-dependent aspect of the same underlying reality.

---

### **6. Testing the Hypothesis**
#### **Predictions**:
- If magnetism is purely a derived effect:
  - Experiments detecting $\vec{B}$ should always correlate it with $\vec{E}$ and charge motion, never as an independent phenomenon.
- Gravitational analogies might arise: $\vec{B}$’s behavior could mirror relativistic corrections to gravity.

#### **Experimentation**:
- Measure electromagnetic phenomena in systems with precise charge motion and acceleration.
- Look for ways to "derive" $\vec{B}$ solely from $\vec{E}$ and motion in real time.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
In this framework:
- **Magnetism** is a derived, mathematical consequence of charge motion and electric field variations.
- **Information Theory** provides a unifying principle: the charge transmits a single stream of data encoding all necessary details, and observers reconstruct magnetic effects locally.
- Maxwell’s equations remain valid but are reinterpreted as transformations rather than fundamental truths.

This interpretation offers a fresh perspective on electromagnetism while preserving its predictive power. Would you like to explore a numerical or visual simulation based on this hypothesis?
