To analyze what forces you’d observe at $P_2$ in terms of **gravity**, **magnetism**, and **electrostatics**, we need to consider the geometry of the field lines and how your measurements (induced voltages) are affected by the **orientation of the wire**.

---

### **1. Direction of Forces at $P_2$**
#### **Gravity**:
- The gravitational force is monopolar, pointing directly toward $P_1$ (assuming $P_1$ has mass $m_1$).
- This force is independent of the wire’s orientation, so it does not contribute to the induced voltage across the wire.

#### **Electrostatic Force** ($\vec{E}$):
- The electric field generated by $P_1$ radiates radially outward if $P_1$ has a net charge.
- If your wire at $P_2$ aligns with the field lines, the voltage across the wire will be proportional to the **projection of $\vec{E}$ along the wire**:
  $$V \propto \int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl}$$
- Rotating the wire changes the alignment with the radial field, leading to varying voltages.

#### **Magnetic Force** ($\vec{B}$):
- A static charge at $P_1$ produces no magnetic field. A moving charge (or current) at $P_1$ generates a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ that forms closed loops around the direction of motion.
- The voltage induced in the wire is due to the changing magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the wire.

### **2. Measuring Induced Voltage Across the Wire**
#### **Setup**:
- Assume the wire at $P_2$ is rotated in steps over $4\pi$ steradians, sampling the field in different orientations.
- Measurements are taken **only when the wire is stationary** at each orientation.

#### **Voltage Contributions**:
1. **Electrostatic Voltage ($V_E$)**:
   - Depends on the wire’s alignment with $\vec{E}$.
   - Maximum voltage occurs when the wire aligns radially with the electric field ($\vec{dl} \parallel \vec{E}$).
   - Voltage drops to zero when the wire is perpendicular to $\vec{E}$ ($\vec{dl} \cdot \vec{E} = 0$).

2. **Magnetic Voltage ($V_B$)**:
   - Depends on the changing flux of $\vec{B}$ through the wire's loop.
   - If $P_1$ is stationary, $V_B = 0$ (no changing flux).
   - If $P_1$ is moving, the induced voltage follows Faraday's law:
     $$V_B = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = -\frac{d}{dt} \int \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}$$
   - The voltage depends on the wire’s orientation and the direction of $\vec{B}$.

### **3. Rotating the Wire in Steps**
#### **Electrostatic Field**:
For a radial electric field ($\vec{E}$), the induced voltage varies with the angle $\theta$ between the wire and the field:
$$V_E(\theta) \propto \cos(\theta)$$
- **Maximum $V_E$**: When $\theta = 0^\circ$ (wire parallel to $\vec{E}$).
- **Zero $V_E$**: When $\theta = 90^\circ$ (wire perpendicular to $\vec{E}$).

#### **Magnetic Field**:
For a moving $P_1$, the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ forms circular loops. The induced voltage depends on the rate of change of the flux through the wire's area:
- $V_B \neq 0$: When the wire encloses a loop with changing magnetic flux.
- **Zero $V_B$**: If the wire does not enclose any flux or $\Phi_B$ is constant.

### **4. Predicted Observations**
1. **Static $P_1$**:
   - Only electrostatic voltage ($V_E$) is observed.
   - Voltage varies sinusoidally as the wire rotates, proportional to $\cos(\theta)$.

2. **Moving $P_1$**:
   - Both $V_E$ and $V_B$ contribute.
   - $V_E$: Follows the sinusoidal variation due to the electric field.
   - $V_B$: Additional oscillatory voltage due to the changing magnetic flux.

3. **Combined $V_E + V_B$**:
   - The measured voltage would show a superposition of the two effects, with the magnetic contribution depending on $P_1$’s velocity and distance.

### **5. Interpretation Without Knowing Distance**
Even without knowing $1/r^3$, you can infer:
1. **Electrostatic Field**:
   - By observing the sinusoidal pattern of $V_E$ with rotation, you can deduce the presence of a radial electric field.

2. **Magnetic Field**:
   - Time-varying $V_B$ indicates motion of $P_1$ and provides indirect information about $\vec{B}$’s structure.

3. **Relative Motion**:
   - The presence of $V_B$, combined with Doppler shifts, reveals relative motion between $P_1$ and $P_2$.

---

### **Summary**
As you rotate the wire:
- The **voltage due to the electrostatic field ($V_E$)** will vary sinusoidally, reaching maxima and minima depending on the wire’s alignment.
- If $P_1$ is moving, the **voltage due to the magnetic field ($V_B$)** will add oscillatory contributions based on the changing flux.
- Without knowing $r$, you cannot directly determine the field’s distance, but the pattern of $V_E$ and $V_B$ can help deduce the direction and motion of $P_1$.
