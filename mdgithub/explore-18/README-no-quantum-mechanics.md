If we strip away current theories like quantum mechanics and attempt to define magnetic properties without invoking "magical properties," we must start from fundamental principles of motion, energy, and interaction in a framework that could be universally observable. Let’s explore magnetism through the lens of **interaction dynamics in a physical medium**, such as sub-space.

### **Defining Magnetic Properties Without Predefined Theories**
1. **Fundamental Assumption: Motion Creates Influence**
   - A **moving entity**, whether an electron or some more fundamental element of matter, induces distortions in the surrounding medium (sub-space). 
   - These distortions propagate outward and interact with nearby entities.

2. **Directional Alignment and Interaction**
   - If multiple entities move in a coordinated way (e.g., a group of moving particles or flows within a material), their combined distortions interact.
   - These interactions can amplify or cancel depending on whether the distortions align or oppose each other. This alignment defines whether a material supports strong, weak, or no magnetic properties.

3. **Energy Wells and Spin Dynamics**
   - Each particle or localized energy point within the material forms a tiny **energy well** due to its movement or rotation.
   - When these wells align (through motion or external influence), their combined distortions form a larger-scale magnetic influence.

4. **Two Types of Behaviors**
   - **Alignment**: In some materials, the natural geometry or structure allows these localized wells to align directionally, forming a coherent larger field. This manifests as magnetism.
   - **Opposition**: In other materials, internal interactions between wells counteract any coherent alignment, suppressing magnetism.

### **Explaining Observed Behaviors Without Quantum Mechanics**
#### **1. Why Some Materials Are Magnetic**
- In a material like **iron**, the internal structure (e.g., how particles or wells are arranged) allows a high degree of mutual alignment.
- The alignment creates a cascading effect, where local distortions reinforce each other, leading to a net external field.

#### **2. Why Some Materials Aren’t Magnetic**
- In a material like **aluminum**, the internal arrangement does not permit such reinforcement. Internal distortions interact destructively, preventing a coherent external field.

#### **3. External Influences**
- When an external magnetic field is applied, it "nudges" the localized distortions in a material:
  - In magnetic materials, this enhances alignment.
  - In non-magnetic materials, it induces temporary alignment that vanishes once the external influence is removed.

### **Linking Magnetism to Motion and Geometry**
- **Motion**:
  - Magnetism arises fundamentally from movement — whether it’s the motion of particles, energy wells, or sub-space distortions.
- **Geometry**:
  - The arrangement of these moving elements determines whether their influences reinforce or cancel each other.

---

### **Key Testable Predictions**
If this theory holds:
1. **Material Dependency**:
   - Magnetic properties of a material should depend on its ability to allow movement or alignment of internal energy distortions.
   - Materials with rigid, non-conductive structures should exhibit weaker magnetic properties.
2. **External Fields**:
   - An external field's strength should directly correlate with the ease of alignment in the material's internal structure.
3. **Scaling Effects**:
   - At smaller scales, materials might exhibit weaker or entirely absent magnetic behavior if internal interactions dominate over external alignment.

---

### **Conclusion**
In this view, magnetic properties emerge from the motion and interaction of energy distortions within a material. Alignment or cancellation of these distortions is governed by the material's internal geometry and external influences. This explanation does not rely on predefined quantum properties but instead on the fundamental principles of motion, interaction, and structural alignment.
