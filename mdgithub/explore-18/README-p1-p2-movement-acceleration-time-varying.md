Acceleration produces time-varying fields because any change in the velocity or position of a charge alters the surrounding electric and magnetic fields, and this change takes time to propagate through space. Here's a detailed explanation of the mechanisms at play:

---

### **1. Electric Field Dynamics**
A stationary charge creates a purely **radial electric field** that decreases as $1/r^2$ with distance. When the charge moves or accelerates:
- **Moving Charge**: If the charge moves at constant velocity, the electric field shifts its orientation to remain "centered" on the charge's instantaneous position, but the field strength at any point remains constant.
- **Accelerating Charge**: When the charge accelerates, the field's shape and magnitude change dynamically. Specifically:
  - The field "lags" behind the charge's motion because changes in the field propagate outward at the speed of light, $c$.
  - This lag creates a **kink or disturbance** in the field lines that propagates outward, resulting in time-varying electric fields.

### **2. Magnetic Field Dynamics**
The magnetic field, generated by the motion of the charge, depends on the velocity ($\vec{v}$) of the charge:
$$\vec{B} \propto \vec{v} \times \vec{E}$$
- If the velocity changes due to acceleration, the magnetic field also changes.
- This results in a time-dependent $\vec{B}$, which induces an electric field in turn (via Faraday's Law).

### **3. Electromagnetic Radiation**
The combination of an accelerating charge's time-varying electric and magnetic fields produces **electromagnetic radiation**:
1. **Field Lines and Kinks**:
   - Changes in the charge’s acceleration create "kinks" or "ripples" in the field lines.
   - These kinks propagate outward at the speed of light and manifest as electromagnetic waves.

2. **Radiation Fields**:
   - The time-varying electric ($\vec{E}$) and magnetic ($\vec{B}$) fields far from the charge are proportional to the acceleration of the charge and fall off as $1/r$:
     $$E_{\text{rad}} \propto \frac{a}{r}, \quad B_{\text{rad}} \propto \frac{a}{r}$$
   - These fields are perpendicular to each other and the direction of propagation, forming the basis of electromagnetic waves.

### **4. The Role of Retarded Potentials**
The concept of **retarded potentials** explains why acceleration causes time-varying fields:
- Any change in the charge’s position, velocity, or acceleration propagates outward at $c$.
- The fields observed at a distance $r$ correspond to the state of the charge at an earlier time:
  $$t_{\text{retarded}} = t - \frac{r}{c}$$
- For an accelerating charge, the delay causes the field at different points in space to vary over time, as the information about the acceleration propagates outward.

---

### **5. Acceleration vs. Constant Velocity**
- **Constant Velocity**:
  - For a charge moving at a constant velocity, the electric field shifts direction but not magnitude. The magnetic field is steady.
  - No electromagnetic waves are produced because there is no change in the fields over time.

- **Acceleration**:
  - Acceleration introduces a second derivative of position ($\ddot{\vec{r}}$) into the equations governing $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$.
  - This second derivative creates oscillatory disturbances in the fields, which propagate outward as electromagnetic waves.

---

### **6. Why Fields Are Time-Varying**
Acceleration causes time-varying fields due to:
1. **Finite Propagation Speed**:
   - Changes in the charge's position, velocity, or acceleration propagate outward at $c$, leading to delays in how the fields adjust in space.
2. **Field Line Kinks**:
   - The field lines need to "reconnect" to the charge's new position, creating disturbances that ripple outward.
3. **Coupling Between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$**:
   - Time-varying electric fields induce magnetic fields, and time-varying magnetic fields induce electric fields, reinforcing the overall time-dependence.

---

### **Conclusion**
Acceleration produces time-varying fields because the changes in the charge’s motion disrupt the equilibrium of the electric and magnetic fields. These disruptions propagate outward, forming electromagnetic waves that carry energy and information about the acceleration. This fundamental process lies at the heart of phenomena like electromagnetic radiation, antennas, and light itself.
