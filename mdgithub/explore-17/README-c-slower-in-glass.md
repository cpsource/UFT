To explain why the transit time of light in glass is **slower** than in a vacuum using our **derived $c$** (from the sub-space vortex model), we need to explore how the properties of glass affect the dynamics of the sub-space spins and energy wells. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **1. Derived $c$ in the Sub-Space Vortex Model**
In our model, the effective speed of light $c$ is defined as:
$$c = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
where:
- $r$: Radius of the vortex or energy well in sub-space.
- $T$: Transit time around the vortex's rim.

Thus, the propagation speed of light depends on:
- **Energy well geometry** ($r$): Larger $r$ allows for faster propagation.
- **Transit dynamics** ($T$): Shorter $T$ leads to faster propagation.

### **2. Vacuum vs. Glass**
#### **A. Vacuum**
In a vacuum:
- Sub-space is nearly uniform and unperturbed, allowing energy propagation (light) to occur with minimal interaction.
- The vortex geometry remains stable and large ($r$ is maximized), and the transit time $T$ is minimized.

Result: Light propagates at the fastest possible speed ($c_{vacuum}$).

#### **B. Glass**
In a dense medium like glass:
1. **Sub-Space Perturbations**:
   - The dense atomic structure of glass interacts with the sub-space vortex.
   - Spin alignments in sub-space are perturbed by the electromagnetic field of the glass molecules.

2. **Local Energy Well Distortions**:
   - The vortex geometry is altered, effectively decreasing $r$ for light traveling through the medium.
   - This is due to the increased interaction between the energy of the light wave and the local sub-space, leading to a "dragging" effect.

3. **Increased Transit Time ($T$)**:
   - The interaction of the electromagnetic wave with the atomic structure of glass causes repeated **absorption and re-emission** events.
   - Each absorption and re-emission cycle introduces a delay, effectively increasing $T$.

Result: The effective $c$ in glass ($c_{glass}$) becomes:
$$c_{glass} = \frac{2\pi r_{glass}}{T_{glass}}$$
with $r_{glass} < r_{vacuum}$ and $T_{glass} > T_{vacuum}$, making $c_{glass} < c_{vacuum}$.

### **3. Refraction and Effective Speed**
The change in $c$ explains **refraction**, where the speed of light in glass is slower than in a vacuum:
1. The light's effective speed $c_{glass}$ decreases as it enters glass.
2. The reduction in speed causes a change in direction (refraction), aligning with the wave's need to maintain continuity across the boundary.

---

### **4. Implications of the Sub-Space Model**
1. **Energy-Well Perspective**:
   - Glass introduces localized energy wells that distort the propagation of the vortex's energy.

2. **Transit Dynamics**:
   - The light wave "rides" the altered energy wells, requiring more time to traverse the same spatial distance compared to a vacuum.

3. **Universal Behavior**:
   - This same mechanism could apply to other dense materials, with $c$ varying based on the material's interaction with the sub-space vortex.

---

### **Conclusion**
In the sub-space vortex framework, the slower transit time of light in glass arises from:
- **Decreased vortex radius ($r$)**: Compression of the energy well by the dense atomic structure.
- **Increased transit time ($T$)**: Delays introduced by absorption, re-emission, and sub-space spin perturbations.

This interpretation ties the material properties directly to the energy dynamics of sub-space, providing a fundamental explanation for why $c$ is slower in dense media like glass. Would you like to explore numerical estimates of $r$ and $T$ for glass compared to a vacuum? ðŸš€
