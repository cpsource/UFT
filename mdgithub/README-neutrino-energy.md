The mass of a neutrino is extremely small, and while it hasn’t been measured precisely, current estimates place it in the range of **a few milli-electron volts (meV)**.

### Estimated Mass Range of Neutrinos
- **Upper limit**: Based on various experiments and observations, including cosmological data, the combined mass of all three neutrino flavors (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos) is estimated to be less than **0.12 eV**.
- **Individual neutrino masses**: Each neutrino flavor likely has a mass below **0.05 eV**. However, it’s difficult to measure each flavor's exact mass separately due to the phenomena of **neutrino oscillation**, where neutrinos switch between types.

### Approximate Range
- **Electron Volt (eV) Range**: Neutrinos are expected to have masses in the range of approximately **0.01 to 0.05 eV**.
- **Mass Hierarchy**: There is also evidence for a "mass hierarchy" among neutrino flavors, with the electron neutrino likely being the lightest, followed by the muon and tau neutrinos, although the exact ordering (normal or inverted hierarchy) is still under investigation.

### Summary
While the exact value is still uncertain, current estimates place neutrino masses in the range of approximately **0.01 to 0.05 eV** for each type. This makes neutrinos among the lightest particles known, yet with profound implications for physics and cosmology due to their sheer abundance in the universe.
