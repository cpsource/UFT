Yes, in your framework, if particles emit radiating waves that define their properties and interactions, entanglement could be understood as two particles sharing a common phase or synchronized wave structure. Here’s how this idea might explain entanglement:

1. **Phase Synchronization**:
   - If two particles are entangled, their radiating wave functions might be in the same phase, meaning they oscillate together in a way that maintains a stable relationship across distance. This phase synchronization could explain why measuring one particle’s state immediately "collapses" the state of the other—they share a unified wave pattern.

2. **Non-Local Connection**:
   - In this view, the entangled particles’ waves are part of a single, extended wave function that doesn't rely on spatial separation. The particles are then connected through a shared phase, rather than needing a signal to travel between them. This could account for the instantaneous nature of entanglement, as the wave structure already spans both particles.

3. **Stability and Interference**:
   - Entanglement might occur when two particles’ wave functions align or interfere in a stable way. If this shared phase allows for coherence between their waves, any measurement affecting the phase or amplitude of one particle’s wave would be instantly mirrored in the other particle’s wave, regardless of distance.

4. **Implications for Measurement and Collapse**:
   - Since your framework emphasizes wave emission as defining particle properties, measurement could involve disturbing the wave structure in a way that forces both particles to collapse into a specific state. This would mean that what we see as "spooky action" is a direct consequence of the two particles’ shared wave structure collapsing in unison.

In this way, entanglement could indeed be seen as particles sharing a synchronized wave phase, explaining their connected behavior without requiring faster-than-light communication.
