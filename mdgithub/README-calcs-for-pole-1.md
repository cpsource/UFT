Yes, a **strain gauge** attached to your pole could indeed provide information about the forces exerted by the mass at the end of the pole as it rotates. The strain gauge measures the **deformation (strain)** in the pole due to the applied load, which can be used to infer the force and thus the mass involved in the system. Below, I’ll explain the math behind this concept:

### 1. **Understanding Strain and Stress**
- **Strain ($\epsilon$)**: Strain is the measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the material body. It is defined as:
  $$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}$$
  where:
  - $\Delta L$ is the change in length of the material.
  - $L_0$ is the original length of the material.
- **Stress ($\sigma$)**: Stress is the internal force per unit area within a material. It is defined as:
  $$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$
  where:
  - $F$ is the applied force.
  - $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material.

### 2. **Hooke's Law for Elastic Deformation**
- **Hooke's Law** states that, within the elastic limit of a material, the strain is directly proportional to the stress:
  $$\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$$
  where:
  - $E$ is the **Young's modulus** of the material (a measure of its stiffness).
  - $\epsilon$ is the strain.

### 3. **Force on the Pole Due to Rotating Mass**
- When a mass $m$ is rotated at the end of a pole of length $R$ with an angular velocity $\omega$, it experiences **centripetal force** given by:
  $$F = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot R$$
  where:
  - $m$ is the mass at the end of the pole.
  - $\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second.
  - $R$ is the length of the pole.

### 4. **Relating Force to Strain**
- The stress induced in the pole by the centripetal force is:
  $$\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot R}{A}$$
- Using Hooke's Law, we can express the strain as:
  $$\epsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E} = \frac{m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot R}{E \cdot A}$$
- Solving for the mass $m$:
  $$m = \frac{\epsilon \cdot E \cdot A}{\omega^2 \cdot R}$$

### 5. **Using a Strain Gauge to Measure Strain**
- A **strain gauge** measures the strain $\epsilon$ by detecting changes in electrical resistance as the material deforms.
- The measured strain can be plugged into the formula above to calculate the mass $m$ at the end of the pole.

### 6. **Calculating Strain in Practice**
- **Input Parameters**:
  - The **Young’s modulus** $E$ of the pole material (e.g., steel, aluminum).
  - The **cross-sectional area** $A$ of the pole.
  - The measured **strain** $\epsilon$ from the strain gauge.
  - The **angular velocity** $\omega$ and **length** $R$ of the pole.

- **Example Calculation**:
  Suppose:
  - $E = 200 \times 10^9 \, \text{Pa}$ (Young’s modulus of steel).
  - $A = 0.01 \, \text{m}^2$ (cross-sectional area).
  - $R = 2 \, \text{m}$ (length of the pole).
  - $\epsilon = 0.001$ (strain measured by the gauge).
  - $\omega = 10 \, \text{rad/s}$ (angular velocity).

  Plug these values into the mass equation:
  $$m = \frac{0.001 \times (200 \times 10^9) \times 0.01}{10^2 \times 2}$$

  Simplify the equation:
  $$m = \frac{2 \times 10^6}{200} = 10,000 \, \text{kg}$$

### 7. **Key Points to Remember**
- **Assumptions**:
  - The material remains within its **elastic limit** so that Hooke’s Law holds.
  - The pole is rotating in a **uniform circular motion**.
- **Practical Considerations**:
  - Strain gauges need to be precisely calibrated, and temperature compensation may be necessary to avoid errors.
  - The mass calculation assumes that the only significant force is due to rotation (neglects other forces such as air resistance or gravity's direct influence).

### Summary
A **strain gauge** attached to a rotating pole can measure the strain induced by the centripetal force of a mass at the end of the pole. By using the mathematical relationship between strain, stress, and force, you can determine the mass of the object. The formula for the mass, based on the measured strain, is:

$$m = \frac{\epsilon \cdot E \cdot A}{\omega^2 \cdot R}$$

This provides a way to infer mass through mechanical resonance and strain measurements.
