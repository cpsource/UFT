To derive the speed of light, $c$, without directly referencing time ($t$), we need to shift our focus to quantities that express the relationship between space, energy, and other fundamental constants. In essence, $c$ can be understood in terms of **properties of spacetime and electromagnetic fields**, allowing us to bypass explicit references to time as a fundamental component. Hereâ€™s a way to think about deriving $c$ without invoking time:

### 1. **Defining $c$ in Terms of Electromagnetic Properties**
   - In physics, $c$ is traditionally defined by the **permittivity** $\varepsilon_0$ and **permeability** $\mu_0$ of free space, two constants that describe the electric and magnetic properties of the vacuum. These constants establish how electric and magnetic fields propagate in a vacuum, giving:
     $$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}}$$
   - Here, $c$ emerges as a property of the space in which electromagnetic fields exist, relating purely to spatial and field properties without requiring an explicit time variable. This shows that $c$ is intrinsic to the nature of space and electromagnetism rather than being directly tied to time as a fundamental factor.

### 2. **Planck Units and the Speed of Light**
   - We can derive $c$ indirectly by combining fundamental constants that express properties of space and matter. In **natural units** or **Planck units**, the speed of light is one of the baseline constants, defined in terms of:
     - Planck length $l_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}$,
     - Planck time $t_P = \frac{l_P}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}$, and
     - Planck energy $E_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}}$.
   - By defining space in terms of the **Planck length** and understanding that **energy and spatial relationships** are invariant under transformations in these units, $c$ naturally arises as the ratio between these derived constants without requiring explicit time.

### 3. **Geometric Interpretation: Spacetime Structure and $c$**
   - If we conceptualize the speed of light in terms of spacetime geometry, **the constant $c$ becomes a conversion factor between space and "potential distance"**, or intervals within a fixed spatial structure.
   - In relativity, $c$ describes the structure of spacetime through the spacetime interval:
     $$s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (c \cdot t)^2$$
   - Removing $t$, we can interpret $c$ as a scalar factor for the transformation between the spatial metric (or lengths) and a characteristic interval intrinsic to the geometry of spacetime itself. In this sense, $c$ characterizes the maximum "rate" of spatial propagation without depending directly on time.

### 4. **Field Theory Perspective**
   - In a field theory context, the speed of light represents the propagation rate of disturbances (or waves) within a **massless field**, like the electromagnetic field. Since massless fields naturally propagate at $c$, this becomes the intrinsic propagation rate of information across space.
   - Here, $c$ represents a spatial relationship within the field, dictating how a wave front extends spatially without referencing an explicit time measure.

### Conclusion
In these frameworks, $c$ can be derived and understood as a **fundamental spatial property of fields and spacetime** itself, related to permittivity, permeability, and Planck units. By considering $c$ as an intrinsic spatial constant rather than a time-dependent property, we bypass the need for time in deriving or understanding it. This aligns with the idea that **$c$ is an emergent characteristic of space and fields** rather than a property rooted in time itself.
