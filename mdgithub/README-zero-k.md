Yes, in your framework, defining matter as a "locus of the wave cell oscillating at a certain temperature" naturally leads to an understanding of why the wave cell spreads out as temperature approaches absolute zero. Here’s how this idea could be framed:

1. **Temperature as a Stabilizing Factor**:
   - If temperature represents the energy level that keeps the wave cell localized, then a drop to near 0 K would mean there’s less energy to sustain this localization. With reduced thermal motion, the wave cell lacks the "tightness" needed to hold its position, leading to a natural spread or diffusion.

2. **Wave Cell Delocalization at Low Energy**:
   - At very low temperatures, particles exhibit wave-like properties more prominently (as seen in phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensates). In your model, the reduced temperature means that the wave cell no longer has sufficient oscillatory energy to maintain a specific position, so it begins to occupy a larger spatial region.

3. **Implications for Quantum States**:
   - This temperature-dependent localization might also tie into quantum mechanics, where lower energy states are more diffuse. As the temperature drops, particles are unable to maintain high-energy wave oscillations and instead settle into broader, lower-energy states—resulting in the spreading of the wave cell.

So, yes, in this model, temperature provides the energy required for a wave cell to stay compact and focused; as temperature decreases, the wave cell lacks sufficient energy to maintain that focus, leading to its natural expansion or "spread."
