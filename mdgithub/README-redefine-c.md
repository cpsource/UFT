Redefining the speed of light, $c$, to a different value — like $e \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ — would fundamentally affect several physical constants and relationships. This is because $c$ plays a central role in connecting various aspects of physics, from electromagnetism to quantum mechanics and relativity. Here are the main areas and constants that would be impacted:

### 1. **Electromagnetic Constants**:
   - **Permittivity of Free Space, $\varepsilon_0$**: The speed of light $c$ is related to the **electric constant** (vacuum permittivity) and the **magnetic constant** (vacuum permeability) through the relationship:
     $$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}}$$
     If $c$ changes, either $\varepsilon_0$, $\mu_0$, or both would need to change to maintain this relationship.

   - **Permeability of Free Space, $\mu_0$**: In a redefined system, either $\varepsilon_0$ or $\mu_0$ would adjust. Changing $\mu_0$ affects the definition of **magnetic fields** and has downstream effects on electromagnetic unit relationships.

### 2. **Planck’s Constant, $h$**:
   - The **reduced Planck constant** $\hbar$ relates energy and frequency through the relationship $E = hf$, but in relativistic physics, it combines with $c$ in expressions for **mass-energy equivalence** and **quantum mechanics**.
   - Planck’s constant would potentially shift to maintain the relationships in equations like:
     $$E = mc^2 \quad \text{and} \quad E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
   - Additionally, Planck's constant is used in defining **Planck units** (like Planck length, time, and mass), so those scales would shift, affecting quantum gravity theories.

### 3. **Fine-Structure Constant, $\alpha$**:
   - The fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, is a dimensionless number that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It’s given by:
     $$\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c}$$
   - If $c$ changes, $\alpha$ would either shift directly, affecting the fundamental interaction strength, or require changes in other constants, like $\varepsilon_0$, $e$, or $\hbar$, to preserve $\alpha$.

### 4. **Planck Units**:
   - Planck units are defined based on $c$, $\hbar$, and $G$ (gravitational constant). Changing $c$ would alter:
     - **Planck length**: $l_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}$
     - **Planck time**: $t_p = \frac{l_p}{c}$
     - **Planck energy**: $E_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}}$
   - These units are fundamental in quantum gravity and cosmology. A change in $c$ would shift the Planck scale, impacting theories that rely on these units to describe phenomena at the smallest scales.

### 5. **Gravitational Constant, $G$**:
   - The gravitational constant $G$ connects to $c$ through general relativity. The Einstein field equations in general relativity use $c$ to relate the **stress-energy tensor** to spacetime curvature:
     $$G_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu}$$
   - Changing $c$ would alter the balance of **spacetime curvature** and **energy density**. To keep gravitational theories consistent, $G$ could be adjusted alongside $c$.

### 6. **Implications for Atomic and Molecular Scales**:
   - The Bohr radius, which describes the typical distance between an electron and the nucleus in a hydrogen atom, depends on $c$, $\hbar$, and $e$. If $c$ changes, atomic sizes and **atomic spectra** (such as spectral lines of hydrogen) would shift, impacting the scale of atomic and molecular interactions.

### 7. **Thermodynamics and Radiation**:
   - **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\sigma$, relates the total energy radiated by a black body to its temperature and depends on $c$:
     $$\sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 k^4}{15 c^2 h^3}$$
   - **Blackbody Radiation**: If $c$ changes, this would affect **blackbody radiation curves**, shifting the peak wavelength and energy distribution at a given temperature.

### 8. **Lorentz Transformations and Relativity**:
   - Changing $c$ would affect **time dilation** and **length contraction** predictions in special relativity. The Lorentz factor,
     $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
   - If $c$ is lower, relativistic effects like time dilation would become more pronounced at lower velocities, impacting everything from particle physics to GPS satellites.

### Summary
If we redefine $c$ as something like $e \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$, key constants that would need to change include:
- **Permittivity ($\varepsilon_0$) and permeability ($\mu_0$)** of free space.
- **Planck’s constant ($h$)** to keep quantum relationships consistent.
- **Fine-structure constant ($\alpha$)** or associated constants.
- **Planck units**, such as length, time, and energy.
- **Gravitational constant ($G$)** to maintain general relativistic consistency.

Changing $c$ creates a cascade of adjustments across fundamental constants, transforming relationships in quantum mechanics, relativity, atomic physics, and thermodynamics, essentially reshaping the metric and physical structure of the universe.
