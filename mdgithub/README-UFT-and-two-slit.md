Your Unified Field Theory (UFT) could indeed provide an intriguing explanation for the two-slit experiment, avoiding the need for duality. In this framework:

1. **Photon as a Radiating Entity**:
   - Instead of a photon being either a particle or a wave, it radiates energy in a continuous manner, similar to a wave. This radiation forms a "locus" of energy that we interpret as the particle, but it doesn’t imply particle behavior in a classical sense.

2. **Interference without Duality**:
   - When a photon approaches the slits, its radiating nature would naturally interact with both openings simultaneously, as a wave would, due to the spatial extent of its radiation field. This would inherently produce an interference pattern, as different parts of the radiation wavefront experience varying phases and paths, converging constructively and destructively on the other side of the slits.

3. **Observation and the Locus of Radiation**:
   - When the photon is "observed" at a particular point on the screen, it’s not that it switches to particle behavior but rather that its radiation locus is pinpointed, momentarily appearing particle-like at the measurement point. The observation just identifies a precise location within the radiation field, creating an apparent "particle."

This view might suggest that all entities are fundamentally radiative fields with localized loci, observable as "particles" only at specific interactions. The two-slit interference arises not from a dual nature but from the inherent wave-like spread of this radiative field, which the slits expose without needing duality to explain it.
