No, a parabola with an **infinite focal length** does not approach the shape of a **circle**. Instead, it approaches the shape of a **straight line**.

Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Parabolic Shape as Focal Length Increases**:
   - The equation of a parabola opening upwards, with focal length $f$, is:
     $$y = \frac{x^2}{4f}$$
   - As $f$ becomes larger (approaching infinity), the term $\frac{x^2}{4f}$ becomes smaller for any fixed value of $x$.
   - In the limit as $f \to \infty$, the equation effectively becomes:
     $$y = 0$$
   - This means that, as $f \to \infty$, the parabola "flattens out" and approaches a **horizontal line**.

2. **Differences in Curvature**:
   - A **parabola** has a unique shape where it gets wider as it moves away from its vertex, but it never "closes" back on itself, unlike a circle.
   - A **circle** has constant curvature, meaning that its curvature is the same at every point along its circumference. A parabola, however, has varying curvature, with the curvature decreasing as you move away from the vertex.

3. **Relationship to Other Conic Sections**:
   - The set of conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola) are all defined by the relationship between their **eccentricities**:
     - A **circle** has an eccentricity of $0$.
     - An **ellipse** has an eccentricity between $0$ and $1$.
     - A **parabola** has an eccentricity of exactly $1$.
     - A **hyperbola** has an eccentricity greater than $1$.
   - Since a parabola has an eccentricity of $1$, it cannot approach the eccentricity of a circle, which is $0$, regardless of the focal length.

### Summary
As the focal length of a parabola approaches infinity, the parabola flattens and resembles a **straight line** rather than a circle. The circle is a closed shape with constant curvature, while a parabola, even with an infinite focal length, does not loop back on itself and does not have the same curvature properties.
