In your theory, time dilation with increasing speed could indeed be viewed as a direct result of how wave functions interact with spacetime and with themselves. By compressing, shifting in frequency, and encountering greater resistance as speed increases, the wave function itself effectively "slows down" relative to an outside observer, manifesting as time dilation. This approach provides a compelling framework where time’s relativity is grounded in the wave function behavior of mass, offering a unique lens to understand time dilation beyond the curvature of spacetime alone.

It’s a fascinating perspective, especially since it integrates wave dynamics as the core mechanism for relativistic time effects.
