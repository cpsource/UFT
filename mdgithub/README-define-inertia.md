You're asking for a deeper, more fundamental understanding of **inertia**, rather than just accepting it as an inherent property of matter. To address this, let's explore how inertia might arise from more fundamental principles and try to express it in terms of other physical quantities.

### 1. **Inertia as Resistance to Acceleration (Newtonian Mechanics)**:
In classical Newtonian mechanics, **inertia** is effectively the same thing as **mass**. It’s what resists acceleration when a force is applied. However, this definition is not sufficient if you're seeking a deeper, more fundamental equation for inertia.

From Newton’s second law:
$$F = ma$$
In this context, **inertia** can be understood as mass ($m$), which describes the resistance to acceleration. However, this only scratches the surface and doesn't offer the deeper explanation you're looking for.

### 2. **Relativistic Inertia** (Mass-Energy Relation):
In **special relativity**, inertia becomes more nuanced. At high speeds (as an object approaches the speed of light), inertia grows due to the increase in **relativistic mass**. This hints at a deeper relationship between inertia and energy. The relativistic expression for inertia is tied to the **total energy** of the system, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The total energy of an object is:
$$E = \gamma mc^2 = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
where:
- $\gamma$ is the **Lorentz factor**.
- $m$ is the rest mass.
- $c$ is the speed of light.
- $v$ is the velocity.

This relationship shows that as the velocity increases, the energy required to accelerate the object increases, and hence the **inertia** increases. In relativity, inertia is not just mass but mass in relation to velocity and energy.

Thus, we could write inertia in the relativistic sense as:
$$\text{Inertia} = \gamma m = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
In this case, inertia is a function of velocity ($v$), mass ($m$), and the speed of light ($c$).

### 3. **Inertia and the Higgs Mechanism (Fundamental Physics)**:
At a fundamental level, **inertia** is linked to the **Higgs field** in particle physics. Particles acquire mass — and therefore inertia — by interacting with the Higgs field. The more strongly a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the greater its mass and, consequently, the greater its inertia.

The Higgs mechanism gives mass to particles through the interaction:
$$m = g \langle \phi \rangle$$
where:
- $g$ is the coupling constant between the particle and the Higgs field.
- $\langle \phi \rangle$ is the **vacuum expectation value** of the Higgs field (approximately 246 GeV in particle physics).

In this context, inertia arises as a result of this interaction with the Higgs field. Therefore, the "resistance" to acceleration could be thought of as the product of the particle's coupling to the field and the field's vacuum expectation value.

So, a simplified expression could be:
$$\text{Inertia} = F(g, \langle \phi \rangle)$$
This describes how the **inertia** of fundamental particles (and thus composite objects like iron) is linked to their interaction with the Higgs field.

### 4. **Inertia and Energy (General Relativity)**:
In **general relativity**, mass and energy are intertwined with the curvature of spacetime. Mass causes spacetime to curve, and the curvature of spacetime affects the motion of objects. In this framework, inertia is not a standalone property but is related to the way mass interacts with the geometry of spacetime.

The **stress-energy tensor** $T_{\mu\nu}$, which describes the distribution of mass, energy, and momentum in spacetime, plays a key role in describing inertia in this framework. The Einstein field equations are:
$$G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$
where:
- $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor, describing spacetime curvature.
- $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor, which contains information about energy and momentum.
- $G$ is the gravitational constant.
- $c$ is the speed of light.

In this context, inertia could be related to the **distribution of energy and momentum** in spacetime, expressed by the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. However, this doesn’t provide a simple expression but emphasizes the role of energy and spacetime curvature in defining how mass and inertia behave.

### 5. **Inertia in Quantum Field Theory**:
In **quantum field theory** (QFT), particles are excitations of underlying fields, and their properties, such as mass and inertia, emerge from the interactions between these fields. As mentioned earlier, the mass of particles arises through the **Higgs mechanism**, but inertia can also be thought of as a function of the **interactions** between quantum fields.

For example, inertia could be expressed as a result of the energy contained in field interactions, and since energy and mass are equivalent ($E = mc^2$), inertia is related to the **total energy** within a system of interacting fields. A full quantum mechanical description of inertia would take into account:
- The interaction energies within the object (interactions among atoms, molecules, etc.).
- The zero-point energies of quantum fields that contribute to the object’s mass and energy.

### 6. **Inertia as Energy Contained in Fields**:
Given all these considerations, one could think of **inertia** as the result of the **energy contained in the object’s mass** and its interaction with external forces (or fields). At a deep level, inertia may be represented as a function of:
- **Energy**: Since mass and energy are interchangeable, inertia can be thought of as the total energy tied to the mass of an object.
- **Field Interactions**: The internal forces between particles, whether via the Higgs field or the electromagnetic field, all contribute to how difficult it is to accelerate the object.

So, if we want to express inertia in a more fundamental sense, we could write:
$$\text{Inertia} = F(E, m, v, \phi)$$
Where:
- $E$ is the total energy of the object.
- $m$ is the mass of the object (related to the Higgs field interaction).
- $v$ is the velocity of the object.
- $\phi$ is the interaction with fields like the Higgs field or gravitational field.

### Summary:
To give you an equation for inertia that goes beyond simply accepting mass as a given, inertia could be expressed as:
$$\text{Inertia} = F(m, E, v, \phi, g, \langle \phi \rangle)$$
where inertia is a function of:
- **Mass** ($m$): The result of the particle’s interaction with the Higgs field.
- **Energy** ($E$): The total energy, including rest energy and any additional energy from motion (relativistic effects).
- **Velocity** ($v$): The object's velocity relative to the observer.
- **Field interactions** ($\phi$): Interactions with fields like the Higgs field or electromagnetic field.
- **Coupling constants** ($g$): Representing how strongly the object’s particles interact with fundamental fields.
- **Vacuum expectation value** ($\langle \phi \rangle$): The strength of the Higgs field, giving rise to mass.

This equation captures the idea that inertia isn't just mass, but a combination of energy, field interactions, and relativistic effects.
