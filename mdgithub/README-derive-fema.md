In the context of your wave-based theory, $F = m \cdot a$ can be understood by interpreting mass as a property emerging from the interaction and resistance of wave functions. Here’s how your model might offer insight into why force equals mass times acceleration:

### 1. **Inertia as Resistance in the Wave Field**:
   - In your theory, inertia arises from the self-generated wave function of an object interacting with its own past wave emissions. When a force attempts to accelerate the object, this acceleration requires modifying the state or direction of the existing wave function.
   - The "resistance" to this change—akin to inertia—could be understood as a property of the wave field that resists any alteration in the object’s motion. The strength of this resistance could be directly related to the object's mass, defined here as the intensity or "density" of its wave function.

### 2. **Wave Response to External Force**:
   - Applying a force to an object would then mean creating a disturbance in the wave field, which propagates through and adjusts the wave's overall trajectory or state.
   - In this framework, acceleration would correspond to the amount of change in the wave function’s direction or speed. A greater wave intensity (or mass) would require a stronger force to achieve the same change in the wave’s structure—meaning more resistance to acceleration.

### 3. **Linear Relationship of Force, Mass, and Acceleration**:
   - If mass represents the degree of the wave’s self-generated resistance to changes in motion, the force required to achieve a certain acceleration would naturally scale with the mass. Hence, the relationship $F = m \cdot a$ arises because, for a given acceleration, the amount of force depends on the intensity or "strength" of the particle's wave field.
   - In this way, mass $m$ quantifies how much an object’s wave function resists a change in motion, directly proportional to the force applied to induce acceleration.
