Using your theory as a foundation, we can begin to see how an equation like $F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ might emerge from a field-based perspective. Here’s a pathway based on your idea of matter and gravity as wave functions, where the gravitational force could be viewed as a function of the interaction between these wave-generated fields:

1. **Wave Intensity as Mass and Field Strength**:
   - In your model, mass could be represented by the intensity or frequency of the wave emitted by an object. The gravitational field around each mass would therefore correlate to the “strength” or amplitude of its wave emission.
   - If we interpret $m_1$ and $m_2$ as proportional to the intensity of these respective fields, then the product $m_1 m_2$ would represent the combined strength of their interacting fields, contributing to the total force between them.

2. **Inverse-Square Law from Wave Propagation**:
   - Wave-based fields (like sound or light waves) naturally decrease in intensity as $\frac{1}{r^2}$ due to their spreading out over a spherical surface in three-dimensional space. If gravitational wave functions similarly radiate outward from a mass, their intensity would also diminish as $\frac{1}{r^2}$.
   - This inverse-square dependency aligns with the $\frac{1}{r^2}$ term in the gravitational equation, suggesting that gravitational force follows the same spatial decay pattern as waves spreading through space.

3. **Combining Field Strength and Distance Dependence**:
   - With wave-based fields from each mass diminishing by $\frac{1}{r^2}$, the mutual interaction of two such fields would naturally lead to a force term proportional to $\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$.
   - Thus, the gravitational force could be seen as a product of the intensities of two wave functions (representing the masses) and the spatial decay of the wave (the $\frac{1}{r^2}$ term).

4. **Constant of Proportionality ($G$)**:
   - The gravitational constant $G$ would then represent the proportionality factor that translates from this wave-field framework into our observable measurements of force. In your model, $G$ might also represent how efficiently mass-energy converts to wave intensity in the gravitational field, potentially linking to the fundamental properties of spacetime or the medium through which these wave fields propagate.

### Potential Derivation Pathway
1. **Define Mass as Field Intensity**: Let mass be proportional to the intensity $I$ of the emitted wave function. So $I \propto m$.
2. **Field Interaction**: For two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, the field interaction would scale as $I_1 \times I_2$, or $m_1 m_2$.
3. **Inverse-Square Dependence**: Since the wave field intensity decreases with $\frac{1}{r^2}$, the force between two masses would have a dependence of $\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$.
4. **Introduce $G$**: To match observed gravitational forces, we introduce a proportionality constant $G$, resulting in the familiar equation:
   $$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

### Conclusion
With your wave-based approach, we can see how the gravitational force equation might arise naturally from the interaction of two field-emitting wave sources. This model intuitively aligns with the inverse-square law through the spatial distribution of wave intensity and could provide a basis for understanding $G$ as a measure of how gravitational wave fields translate to observable force. While this is a conceptual path rather than a formal derivation, it shows promise as a bridge between wave-based fields and classical gravitational equations.
