Yes, it would be possible to send a robot to **Proxima Centauri b** with a dual-dial clock as you described, provided the clock is carefully designed to account for relativistic and gravitational effects over the journey and on the planet's surface. Here’s how it could be implemented:

### **Dual-Dial Clock Concept**

1. **Dial 1 (UTC Clock)**:
   - This dial would run on **Earth-based UTC time**, synchronized to Earth's time at the moment of launch.
   - It would not compensate for relativistic effects experienced during the journey or on Proxima Centauri b.
   - This dial serves as a reference for how much time has passed relative to Earth’s "frame of reference."

2. **Dial 2 (Compensated Clock)**:
   - This dial would apply corrections for:
     - **Relativistic Time Dilation**: Due to the robot's high velocity during the journey and potentially from orbiting Proxima Centauri b.
     - **Gravitational Time Dilation**: Proxima Centauri b’s gravity is weaker than Earth's, so time would run faster there.
   - The corrections would keep this clock aligned with what "local time" would look like if we adjusted for these effects, effectively providing a timepiece in the robot’s own relativistic frame.

### **Feasibility**
Implementing such a clock is challenging but feasible with current and near-future technology:

1. **Relativistic Corrections**:
   - Use precise calculations based on **Special Relativity** to adjust for time dilation during the journey:
     - At high speeds (e.g., 10% the speed of light), time on the spacecraft would slow relative to Earth.
     - The correction factor is $\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}$, where $v$ is the velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.
   - Similarly, apply **General Relativity** corrections to account for Proxima Centauri b’s weaker gravitational field compared to Earth.

2. **Journey Duration**:
   - If the spacecraft travels at 10% the speed of light, the journey would take ~**42 years** (Earth time). Onboard time would be slightly shorter due to time dilation (e.g., ~41.8 years onboard at that speed).

3. **Clock Technology**:
   - Modern **atomic clocks** are precise enough to measure these relativistic effects. Optical lattice clocks, for example, could detect even nanosecond-level discrepancies over the journey.

4. **Synchronization and Verification**:
   - The clock would be synchronized to UTC before launch.
   - During the journey, it could record its motion and environmental conditions (velocity, gravitational potential) to refine its relativistic corrections.
   - Once on Proxima Centauri b, data from the clock would allow scientists to verify predictions about time dilation and gravitational effects at the planet.

### **Purpose of the Dual-Dial Clock**
1. **Experimental Validation**:
   - By comparing the two dials after the mission, scientists could verify the accumulated relativistic effects over such a long journey and in a different gravitational field.
   - This would provide a unique test of **Einstein’s theories of relativity** over interstellar distances.

2. **Timekeeping on Proxima Centauri b**:
   - The compensated clock (Dial 2) could serve as the basis for a **local time system** on Proxima Centauri b.
   - Dial 1 (UTC) would remain a reference to Earth time for communication and synchronization purposes.

3. **Interplanetary Time Standards**:
   - This experiment could pave the way for defining a universal or **galactic time standard** that accounts for relativistic and gravitational effects in interstellar exploration.

### **Challenges**
1. **Precision Over Long Durations**:
   - Even atomic clocks may experience minor drift over decades. This must be minimized to maintain accuracy.

2. **Communication Delays**:
   - At 4.24 light-years away, signals from the robot would take ~4.24 years to reach Earth, making real-time updates impossible.

3. **Environmental Interference**:
   - The clock must operate reliably in harsh conditions (cosmic radiation, extreme temperatures) during the journey and on Proxima Centauri b.

### **Outcome**
- Upon arrival, the two dials would diverge:
  - The UTC clock would show how much time has passed on Earth.
  - The compensated clock would show how much time has passed locally (corrected for all relativistic and gravitational effects).
- Comparing the two clocks would provide invaluable data on the cumulative effects of relativity over interstellar distances and help establish interplanetary timekeeping standards.

This dual-dial clock concept is not only possible but would be a groundbreaking experiment in the realm of physics and interstellar exploration!
