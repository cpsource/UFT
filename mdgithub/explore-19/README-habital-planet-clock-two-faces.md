To determine which clock face—**the UTC clock** (Earth time) or **the compensated clock** (relativistic effects corrected)—would be ahead depends on the specifics of the journey and the gravitational environment on **Proxima Centauri b**. Let’s break it down:

---

### **Key Effects on Each Clock**

1. **Dial 1 (UTC Clock)**:
   - This clock is synchronized to Earth time and does not account for relativistic effects experienced by the spacecraft.
   - Time measured by this clock is effectively "faster" because it ignores:
     - **Special Relativity**: Time dilation due to the spacecraft's high velocity during the journey.
     - **General Relativity**: Gravitational effects on Proxima Centauri b.

2. **Dial 2 (Compensated Clock)**:
   - This clock adjusts for relativistic effects, including:
     - **Time dilation during the journey**: The spacecraft is moving at a high fraction of the speed of light, so its time runs slower relative to Earth.
     - **Gravitational effects on Proxima Centauri b**: Time on Proxima Centauri b runs slightly faster than on Earth because its weaker gravity reduces the gravitational time dilation.

### **During the Journey**
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation (Special Relativity)**:
   - The spacecraft's high speed slows down time for the onboard clocks relative to Earth.
   - The compensated clock (Dial 2) accounts for this and runs slower than the UTC clock (Dial 1), which remains synchronized to Earth time.

   **Result**: During the journey, **Dial 1 (UTC)** would be ahead of **Dial 2 (Compensated)**.

### **On Proxima Centauri b**
Once the spacecraft arrives, the situation changes due to gravitational time dilation.

1. **Weaker Gravity on Proxima Centauri b**:
   - Proxima Centauri b has about **0.8 times Earth's mass** but a smaller radius (~0.9 Earth radii), resulting in a weaker gravitational field at the surface.
   - Time on Proxima Centauri b would run slightly faster than on Earth due to its weaker gravity.

   **Effect**: 
   - The compensated clock (Dial 2) would now adjust for this and run **faster** than the UTC clock (Dial 1), which remains tied to Earth's slower time.

### **Final Comparison**
When the robot arrives and you compare the two clocks:
1. **UTC Clock (Dial 1)**:
   - This clock has continuously run based on Earth time and accumulated more time than the compensated clock during the journey.
   - However, once on Proxima Centauri b, it runs slightly slower than local time due to Earth's stronger gravitational pull.

2. **Compensated Clock (Dial 2)**:
   - During the journey, it lags behind the UTC clock because it adjusts for relativistic time dilation.
   - After arrival, it "catches up" and may even surpass the UTC clock due to faster local time on Proxima Centauri b.

---

### **Which Clock Is Ahead?**
- **During the Journey**: The **UTC clock (Dial 1)** is ahead because time dilation slows the compensated clock.
- **After Arrival on Proxima Centauri b**:
  - Initially, the UTC clock will still be ahead.
  - Over time, the compensated clock (Dial 2) could "catch up" and eventually run faster than the UTC clock because time on Proxima Centauri b moves slightly faster due to weaker gravity.

### **Example with Hypothetical Numbers**
1. **Journey Time (Earth Frame)**:
   - 42 years Earth time, traveling at 10% the speed of light.
   - Time dilation reduces onboard time to ~41.8 years.

2. **Arrival**:
   - **Dial 1 (UTC)**: Shows 42 years.
   - **Dial 2 (Compensated)**: Shows ~41.8 years.

3. **On Proxima Centauri b**:
   - Each year on the planet runs faster by a tiny fraction compared to Earth. Over time, **Dial 2** would overtake **Dial 1**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Initially, **Dial 1 (UTC)** will be ahead when the robot lands, but over time, **Dial 2 (Compensated)** may overtake it due to the faster passage of time on Proxima Centauri b. This fascinating interplay reflects both the journey’s relativistic effects and the differences in gravitational environments!
