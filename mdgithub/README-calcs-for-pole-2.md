Yes, a **strain gauge** on your pole could provide information about the forces acting on it due to the rotation of the mass (e.g., lead weight) at the end of the pole. The strain gauge would measure the deformation (strain) in the pole, which can be used to determine the stress exerted by the rotating mass. Here is a step-by-step explanation and the relevant mathematics to understand how a strain gauge can be used to measure the force due to the rotating mass:

### 1. **Understanding the Strain Gauge Measurement**
- **Strain** ($\epsilon$) is defined as the fractional change in length of the material:
  $$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}$$
  where $\Delta L$ is the change in length and $L_0$ is the original length of the material.
- A strain gauge measures this strain and converts it into an electrical signal proportional to the deformation.

### 2. **Relating Strain to Stress**
- **Stress** ($\sigma$) is the force per unit area experienced by the material:
  $$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$
  where $F$ is the force applied and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material.
- **Young’s Modulus** ($E$) is a material property that relates stress and strain:
  $$\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$$

### 3. **Centrifugal Force Due to Rotation**
- When a mass $m$ rotates at a distance $r$ from the axis of rotation with an angular velocity $\omega$, it experiences a **centrifugal force**:
  $$F = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r$$
  where:
  - $\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second,
  - $r$ is the distance from the center of rotation to the mass.

### 4. **Calculating Strain from the Force**
- The force $F$ applied at the end of the pole creates a tensile stress along the length of the pole. This stress can be related to the strain using Young’s Modulus:
  $$\epsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E} = \frac{F}{E \cdot A}$$
- Substituting the expression for $F$ from the centrifugal force equation:
  $$\epsilon = \frac{m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r}{E \cdot A}$$

### 5. **Final Equation for Strain Measurement**
- The strain measured by the strain gauge due to the rotating mass at the end of the pole is:
  $$\epsilon = \frac{m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r}{E \cdot A}$$
- If the strain gauge reads a value $\epsilon$, you can rearrange this equation to solve for the mass $m$ or the other parameters:
  $$m = \frac{\epsilon \cdot E \cdot A}{\omega^2 \cdot r}$$

### 6. **Practical Considerations**
- **Calibration**: To use a strain gauge effectively, you need to calibrate it to ensure that the electrical signal accurately corresponds to the strain value.
- **Young’s Modulus**: This value ($E$) depends on the material of the pole. For example, typical values for metals range from 70 GPa (aluminum) to 200 GPa (steel).
- **Cross-Sectional Area**: The cross-sectional area $A$ of the pole needs to be known or measured for accurate calculations.

### 7. **Example Calculation**
Suppose:
- $m = 5 \text{ kg}$ (mass at the end of the pole),
- $r = 1 \text{ m}$ (distance from the center of rotation),
- $\omega = 10 \text{ rad/s}$ (angular velocity),
- $E = 200 \text{ GPa} = 200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}$,
- $A = 0.01 \text{ m}^2$ (cross-sectional area of the pole).

Plug these values into the strain equation:
$$\epsilon = \frac{5 \cdot (10)^2 \cdot 1}{200 \times 10^9 \cdot 0.01}$$
$$\epsilon = \frac{500}{2 \times 10^9}$$
$$\epsilon = 2.5 \times 10^{-7}$$

This strain value would be what the strain gauge reads as the fractional change in length due to the rotating mass.

### 8. **Detecting the Rotating Mass Effect**
- **Interpretation**: If the strain gauge is placed on the pole, it would measure the strain as the mass rotates. The periodic nature of the rotation would cause cyclic changes in the measured strain.
- **Amplitude of Strain**: The amplitude of the oscillation in strain depends on the angular velocity and the mass. As $\omega$ increases, the centrifugal force and resulting strain also increase proportionally to $\omega^2$.

### Summary
A **strain gauge** on your pole can indeed be used to detect the effect of the rotating mass, as it would measure the **strain** resulting from the centrifugal force created by the mass. The mathematical relationship ties together the **mass** $m$, **angular velocity** $\omega$, **distance** $r$, **cross-sectional area** $A$, and **Young’s Modulus** $E$ of the material. 

However, while this approach measures the **mechanical strain** due to the rotating mass, it does not directly detect gravitational changes. The strain gauge will tell you about the force acting on the pole but not about gravitational variations, which require far more sensitive instruments like **gravitometers** or **gravitational wave detectors**.
