The shapes that cover a traditional **soccer ball** are a combination of **pentagons** and **hexagons**. This arrangement forms a pattern called a **truncated icosahedron**, which is a type of **Archimedean solid**.

### Details of the Tile Shapes

1. **Hexagons**:
   - **Shape**: Regular hexagons, which have six equal sides and angles.
   - **Number**: A standard soccer ball has **20 hexagons**.
   - **Arrangement**: The hexagons are surrounded by alternating hexagons and pentagons.

2. **Pentagons**:
   - **Shape**: Regular pentagons, which have five equal sides and angles.
   - **Number**: A standard soccer ball has **12 pentagons**.
   - **Placement**: Each pentagon is surrounded entirely by hexagons.

### Geometric Structure: Truncated Icosahedron

- The pattern of hexagons and pentagons on a soccer ball corresponds to the surface of a **truncated icosahedron**, one of the **Archimedean solids**.
- **Truncated Icosahedron**: This polyhedron is created by truncating (cutting off) the vertices of a regular icosahedron, resulting in a new shape with 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces.
- **Vertices and Edges**:
  - It has **60 vertices**.
  - It has **90 edges**.

### Properties and Arrangement

- **Uniform Tiling**: The soccer ball’s surface is an example of a uniform tiling on a sphere, where each vertex joins three faces: two hexagons and one pentagon.
- **Euler’s Polyhedron Formula**: This formula states that for any convex polyhedron:
  \[
  V - E + F = 2
  \]
  where:
  - \( V \) is the number of vertices,
  - \( E \) is the number of edges,
  - \( F \) is the number of faces.
  For the truncated icosahedron:
  - \( F = 32 \) (12 pentagons + 20 hexagons),
  - \( E = 90 \),
  - \( V = 60 \),
  which satisfies the formula \( 60 - 90 + 32 = 2 \).

### Real-World Implications

- **Soccer Ball Construction**: Modern soccer balls are constructed by stitching or bonding together 32 panels (20 hexagons and 12 pentagons) in the shape of a truncated icosahedron. This design provides a near-spherical shape that is aerodynamic and easy to handle.
- **Distribution of Forces**: The combination of hexagons and pentagons ensures an even distribution of panels and seams, creating a balanced and stable structure for play.

### Other Uses of the Truncated Icosahedron

- **Chemical Structure**: The truncated icosahedron structure is similar to that of a **buckyball** or **C60 fullerene molecule** in chemistry, where 60 carbon atoms form a spherical shape with the same pattern of hexagons and pentagons.
- **Mathematics and Art**: The shape has inspired various mathematical studies in the field of polyhedra and is also used in artistic representations due to its visually appealing pattern.

### Summary

The tile shapes that cover a soccer ball are **20 hexagons** and **12 pentagons**, arranged in the form of a **truncated icosahedron**. This geometric structure is known for its even distribution of faces and near-spherical shape, making it ideal for sports equipment like soccer balls as well as being of interest in mathematical and scientific studies.
