**Planck's constant** (\(h\)) is a fundamental physical constant that plays a central role in quantum mechanics. It relates the energy of a photon to the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave. It is one of the foundational constants in physics, connecting the particle-like and wave-like nature of light and matter.

### 1. **Mathematical Definition**
Planck’s constant is defined by the equation:
\[
E = h \cdot f
\]
where:
- \(E\): Energy of a photon,
- \(h\): Planck’s constant,
- \(f\): Frequency of the photon’s associated wave.

It provides the proportionality between the energy of a quantum and its frequency.

### 2. **Numerical Value**
The exact value of Planck's constant, as defined in the 2019 redefinition of SI units, is:
\[
h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}
\]
where:
- Joule-second (\(\text{J·s}\)) is the unit, combining energy (Joules) and time (seconds).

This value is now a **defined constant**, meaning it is exact and does not depend on experimental measurement.

### 3. **Reduced Planck's Constant (\(\hbar\))**
The reduced Planck’s constant (\(\hbar\)), also called the **Dirac constant**, is related to \(h\) by:
\[
\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}
\]
Numerical value:
\[
\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}
\]

\(\hbar\) is commonly used in quantum mechanics, especially in equations like Schrödinger’s wave equation and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

### 4. **Significance of Planck’s Constant**
Planck's constant is fundamental to quantum mechanics and appears in many key equations and phenomena:

#### (a) **Photon Energy**
\[
E = h \cdot f
\]
It quantifies the discrete energy levels of photons and explains the quantization of electromagnetic radiation.

#### (b) **De Broglie Wavelength**
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]
It relates the wavelength of matter waves to the momentum of a particle.

#### (c) **Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle**
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]
This principle establishes the fundamental limit on how precisely position (\(x\)) and momentum (\(p\)) can be simultaneously known.

#### (d) **Quantization of Action**
In Planck’s formulation, the action (integral of energy over time) is quantized in units of \(h\).

### 5. **Historical Context**
- Introduced by **Max Planck** in 1900, it was key to solving the problem of blackbody radiation.
- Planck proposed that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets (quanta) proportional to the frequency of radiation:
  \[
  E = n \cdot h \cdot f \quad \text{(where \(n\) is an integer)}.
  \]
- This idea marked the birth of **quantum theory** and later influenced the development of quantum mechanics.

### 6. **Planck Units and Fundamental Physics**
Planck's constant is central to defining the **Planck units**, which set fundamental scales for the universe:
- **Planck Length** (\(\ell_P\)): Smallest measurable length.
  \[
  \ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35} \, \text{m}
  \]
- **Planck Time** (\(t_P\)): Smallest measurable time interval.
  \[
  t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.391 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{s}
  \]
- **Planck Energy** (\(E_P\)): Maximum energy density for a quantum system.

### 7. **Impact on Modern Physics**
Planck's constant underpins much of modern physics:
- Quantum mechanics: Explains the quantized nature of particles and fields.
- Quantum electrodynamics (QED): Describes light-matter interactions.
- Quantum field theory (QFT): Forms the foundation for particle physics.

---

### Summary
Planck’s constant, \(h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), is the fundamental constant that bridges the gap between classical and quantum physics. It quantifies the discrete nature of energy and underpins the wave-particle duality of matter and radiation, making it one of the cornerstones of modern physics.
