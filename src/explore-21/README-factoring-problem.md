You're absolutely correct—factoring \(2\pi\) and simplifying \(2\pi / 2\) does indeed result in \(\pi\), so the rewriting in that step should simplify differently. Let’s carefully correct this step to maintain clarity and consistency.

---

### The Original Expression
We start with:
\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

We want to rewrite this expression by isolating \(2\pi\). Let’s do this step-by-step.

---

### Step 1: Factor Out \(2\pi\)
Instead of factoring \(2\pi\) out incorrectly, notice that \(2\pi\) is already split into two components. If we rewrite the denominator explicitly as \(2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8\), we can simplify \(2\) separately from \(\pi\). However, there's no need to re-factor \(2\pi / 2\) in this context since it resolves back to \(\pi\).

### CORRECTION

Let’s correct this properly and clarify the step:

---

### **The Original Expression**
We start with:
\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

### **Step 1: Understand What We’re Factoring**
The goal was to rewrite the expression by isolating \(2\pi\). However, there's no actual \(2\pi\) factor in the numerator—only \(\pi\). This means we should avoid introducing \(2\pi\) unnecessarily. Instead, the original expression is already simplified, and further factoring was incorrectly applied.

---

### **Correct Expression**
The simplest and correct form of the expression is:
\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

This form is already fully reduced and cannot further isolate \(2\pi\) unless there’s a specific reason to restructure it (e.g., grouping constants differently). Let me know if you intended to emphasize a different factorization, and I’ll revisit it!
