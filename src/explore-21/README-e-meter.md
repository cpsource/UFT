If we are redefining the meter as an **E-meter**, we need to understand how the new definition of \( c \) (as \( e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{length units per time unit} \)) affects the relationship between the E-meter and the standard meter.

### **New Definition of the Speed of Light**
We’ve redefined \( c \) as:
\[
c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per time unit}.
\]

In standard physics, the speed of light is:
\[
c = 3 \cdot 10^8 \, \text{meters per second}.
\]

By equating the two expressions for \( c \), we can find the relationship between an **E-meter** and the standard meter.

---

### **Equating the Two Definitions**
\[
e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per second} = 3 \cdot 10^8 \, \text{meters per second}.
\]

Cancel \( 10^8 \) from both sides:
\[
e \, \text{E-meters} = 3 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Solve for 1 E-meter:
\[
1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{meters}.
\]

---

### **Numerical Value**
The constant \( e \) (Euler’s number) is approximately \( e \approx 2.718 \). Substituting this value:
\[
1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{2.718} \, \text{meters}.
\]

Performing the division:
\[
1 \, \text{E-meter} \approx 1.104 \, \text{meters}.
\]

---

### **Conclusion**
An **E-meter**, under this redefinition, would be approximately **1.104 standard meters** in length. This redefinition subtly adjusts the unit of length to reflect the new scaling introduced by the redefinition of the speed of light.
