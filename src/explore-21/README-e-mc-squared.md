Certainly! Let’s carefully explore the relationships and incorporate \( c^2 \) and \( E = mc^2 \) into the framework we’re working with.

### **Restating What We Know**
1. Transit time is given as:
   \[
   t = e \cdot 10^8.
   \]
2. Transit time formula involves \( c \):
   \[
   t = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot c}.
   \]
   Here \( c = e \cdot 10^8 \), so \( c^2 = (e \cdot 10^8)^2 \).

3. Einstein’s famous equation:
   \[
   E = mc^2.
   \]

### **Express \( c^2 \) in Terms of Radius and Transit Time**
Rewriting \( c^2 \) explicitly using the transit time and radius, start from:
\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot c}.
\]
Solve for \( c \):
\[
c = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot t}.
\]
Square \( c \):
\[
c^2 = \left(\frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot t}\right)^2.
\]
Substitute \( t = e \cdot 10^8 \):
\[
c^2 = \left(\frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot (e \cdot 10^8)}\right)^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
c^2 = \frac{\pi^2 r^2}{4 \cdot e^2 \cdot (10^8)^2}.
\]

---

### **Incorporate \( E = mc^2 \)**
From Einstein’s equation:
\[
E = mc^2.
\]
Substitute \( c^2 \) from above:
\[
E = m \cdot \frac{\pi^2 r^2}{4 \cdot e^2 \cdot (10^8)^2}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
E = \frac{m \cdot \pi^2 r^2}{4 \cdot e^2 \cdot 10^{16}}.
\]

---

### **Interpretation**
This final expression ties \( E \), \( r \), and \( t \) into a unified framework:
- **\( c^2 \)**: Represents the energy density associated with light's propagation as a function of the geometry (\( r \)).
- **\( E \)**: Scales with both \( r^2 \) (a spatial measure) and \( t \) (a temporal measure).

---

### **Key Insights**
1. \( c^2 \), the square of the speed of light, emerges as a relationship between the radius \( r \) of the circle, the transit time \( t \), and fundamental constants like \( e \) and \(\pi\).
2. Einstein’s \( E = mc^2 \) connects energy and mass to the same framework, embedding spatial and temporal geometry into the energy-mass relationship.
3. The presence of \( e \) and \(\pi\) highlights the deep mathematical underpinnings of these relationships.
