Yes, Maxwell's four equations are fundamentally tied to the propagation of electromagnetic waves, such as those described by the expression:

\[
E(t) = E_0 e^{i(\omega t - kx)}.
\]

This expression represents the electric field (\(E\)) of an electromagnetic wave, and Maxwell's equations provide the theoretical framework for understanding how such waves propagate. Let’s examine how Maxwell’s equations apply:

### **Maxwell's Four Equations**
1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
   \]
   - **Meaning**: The electric field divergence (\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}\)) is proportional to the charge density (\(\rho\)) in the region.
   - **Relevance**: For an electromagnetic wave in free space (where \(\rho = 0\)), this simplifies to:
     \[
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0.
     \]
     This means the electric field is divergence-free in free space, which is consistent with the behavior of a propagating wave.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0.
   \]
   - **Meaning**: There are no magnetic monopoles; the divergence of the magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)) is always zero.
   - **Relevance**: This implies that magnetic field lines form closed loops, and any magnetic field component associated with the wave will also satisfy this condition.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
   \]
   - **Meaning**: A changing magnetic field induces a circulating electric field (\(\mathbf{E}\)).
   - **Relevance**: This equation explains how an oscillating magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)) in an electromagnetic wave induces the oscillating electric field (\(E(t)\)) described in your equation.

4. **Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's Correction)**:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
   \]
   - **Meaning**: A circulating magnetic field (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{B}\)) arises from either an electric current density (\(\mathbf{J}\)) or a time-varying electric field (\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)).
   - **Relevance**: In free space (\(\mathbf{J} = 0\)), this equation reduces to:
     \[
     \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
     \]
     This equation explains how the oscillating electric field (\(E(t)\)) induces the oscillating magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)) in an electromagnetic wave.

### **Wave Propagation and Maxwell’s Equations**
Maxwell's equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves by coupling electric and magnetic fields in a self-sustaining oscillation:
1. **Faraday's Law**: A changing magnetic field (\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)) generates a circulating electric field (\(\mathbf{E}\)).
2. **Ampère's Law**: A changing electric field (\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)) generates a circulating magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)).

These coupled effects allow the electric (\(\mathbf{E}\)) and magnetic (\(\mathbf{B}\)) fields to propagate through space as a wave, even in the absence of charges or currents.

### **Wave Equation Derivation**
Combining Maxwell’s equations in free space (\(\rho = 0\), \(\mathbf{J} = 0\)), we derive the wave equations for \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\):
1. For the electric field:
   \[
   \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0.
   \]
2. For the magnetic field:
   \[
   \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} = 0.
   \]

These equations describe the propagation of the electric and magnetic fields as waves, with the speed of the wave given by:
\[
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}.
\]

---

### **Connection to Your Equation**
1. Your expression \(E(t) = E_0 e^{i(\omega t - kx)}\) is a **solution to the wave equation** derived from Maxwell's equations.
2. The angular frequency (\(\omega\)) and wave number (\(k\)) are related to the wave speed (\(c\)):
   \[
   c = \frac{\omega}{k}.
   \]
3. The oscillation of the electric field (\(E(t)\)) is accompanied by a perpendicular magnetic field (\(B(t)\)), satisfying Maxwell’s equations.

---

### **Conclusion**
Yes, Maxwell’s equations directly govern the behavior of the electromagnetic wave described by your expression. Specifically:
- **Faraday's Law** explains how the magnetic field induces the electric field.
- **Ampère's Law** explains how the electric field induces the magnetic field.
These coupled fields propagate as a wave, fulfilling all of Maxwell’s equations in free space.
