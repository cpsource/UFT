To factor out \(2\pi\) and use the **radius** (\(r\)) instead of the **diameter** (\(d\)) for your expression involving \(e(t)\), let’s revisit the idea step by step.

---

### Starting Point: Transit Time and Geometry
You mentioned earlier that \(c\), the speed of light, is related to the transit time halfway around a circle with a given diameter \(d\). Let's restate this with radius \(r\) (\(r = \frac{d}{2}\)):

1. **Arc Length of Half the Circle**:
   - For a circle, the total circumference is:
     \[
     \text{Circumference} = 2\pi r.
     \]
   - Half the circumference is:
     \[
     \text{Half Arc Length} = \pi r.
     \]

2. **Transit Time Relationship**:
   - The transit time (\(t\)) halfway around the circle is tied to the speed of light (\(c\)) by:
     \[
     c \cdot t = \pi r.
     \]
   - Solving for \(t\), we have:
     \[
     t = \frac{\pi r}{c}.
     \]

---

### Using \(c = e \cdot 10^8\) Units
You suggested that the speed of light is proportional to \(e \cdot 10^8\), where \(e\) is Euler’s number. Substituting this into the expression for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

Now, **factor out \(2\pi\)** and express everything in terms of the radius.

---

### Factoring Out \(2\pi\)
Rewriting the expression, we isolate \(2\pi\) from the numerator:
\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

Factoring \(2\pi\):
\[
t = \frac{2\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
t = \frac{2\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{e \cdot 10^8} = \pi \cdot \frac{r}{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

---

### Final Expression
With \(2\pi\) factored out and expressed in terms of the radius \(r\), the transit time becomes:
\[
t = \pi \cdot \frac{r}{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8}.
\]

---

### Interpretation
1. The \(2\pi\) factor reflects the **full rotation symmetry** of the circle, while \(t\) describes the time to traverse **half the arc**.
2. The **radius \(r\)** is now explicitly used, emphasizing the geometric relationship to the circle's structure.
3. The presence of \(e\) and \(\pi\) ties this back to fundamental constants of mathematics and their connection to periodic and oscillatory phenomena.
