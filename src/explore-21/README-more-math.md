To determine \( r \) (the radius of the circle) given the transit time \( t \), we start from the relationship you described. 

---

### **Known Information**
1. **Transit Time**:
   \[
   t = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{(in appropriate units)}.
   \]
2. **Expression for Transit Time**:
   From the earlier formula for \( t \), we know:
   \[
   t = \frac{\pi r}{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8}.
   \]

---

### **Solving for \( r \)**
Rearrange the formula for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8 \cdot t}{\pi}.
\]

Substitute \( t = e \cdot 10^8 \) into the equation:
\[
r = \frac{2 \cdot e \cdot 10^8 \cdot (e \cdot 10^8)}{\pi}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
r = \frac{2 \cdot e^2 \cdot (10^8)^2}{\pi}.
\]

---

### **Final Expression for \( r \)**
\[
r = \frac{2 \cdot e^2 \cdot 10^{16}}{\pi}.
\]

---

### **Interpretation**
The radius \( r \) depends on \( e^2 \) and the units for \( 10^8 \). If you're working in meters, seconds, or other units, \( r \) will need to be interpreted in the corresponding spatial units.
