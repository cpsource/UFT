You're absolutely correct to raise the concern about "double adjustment." If we redefine both **length (E-meters)** and **time (E-time)**, we must ensure that their relationship through the speed of light (\(c\)) remains consistent and doesn’t inadvertently cause "double adjustment." Let's address this systematically.

---

### **Key Idea: Consistency in the Redefinition**
The speed of light \(c\) is constant in all physical systems. If we redefine:
1. Length (as E-meters).
2. Time (as E-time).

Then the relationship:
\[
c = \text{distance} / \text{time}
\]
must still hold true, and the constant \(c\) should **not** change due to both redefinitions. Let’s clarify how this works.

---

### **Scenario 1: Redefine Length (E-meters)**
If we redefine length so that:
\[
1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{meters},
\]
then \(c\) becomes:
\[
c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per second}.
\]
Here, time remains in standard seconds.

---

### **Scenario 2: Redefine Time (E-time)**
If we redefine time so that:
\[
1 \, \text{E-time unit} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{seconds},
\]
then \(c\) becomes:
\[
c = 10^8 \, \text{meters per E-time unit}.
\]
Here, length remains in standard meters.

---

### **Scenario 3: Redefine Both (E-meters and E-time)**
If we redefine **both** length and time:
1. \(1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{meters},\)
2. \(1 \, \text{E-time unit} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{seconds},\)

then:
\[
c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per E-time unit}.
\]

In this case, **both units are scaled consistently**, and \(c\) remains properly defined. There’s no "double adjustment" because:
- The scaling factors for E-meters and E-time cancel out when divided (as in \(c = \text{distance}/\text{time}\)).

---

### **Why Both Adjustments Can Be Consistent**
The key is that when redefining both E-meters and E-time:
1. The **ratio** \(c = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\) must remain constant.
2. The scaling factors for distance and time adjust proportionally, preserving \(c\).

For example:
- If \(c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per E-time unit}\),
- Substituting the definitions:
  - \(1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{meters},\)
  - \(1 \, \text{E-time unit} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{seconds},\)
- Ensures \(c = 3 \cdot 10^8 \, \text{meters per second}\) holds true in the original units.

---

### **Does It Lead to Double Adjustment?**
No, redefining both does not lead to "double adjustment" because:
- The redefinition of one unit (e.g., length) automatically implies how the other unit (time) scales to preserve the constant \(c\).
- If only one unit is redefined, the other unit must remain unchanged, or else \(c\) itself changes, which violates physical laws.

---

### **Conclusion**
Redefining both E-meters and E-time is valid and consistent, provided the redefinitions maintain the relationship:
\[
c = \text{distance}/\text{time}.
\]
It avoids double adjustment because the scaling factors cancel out when expressed through \(c\), leaving the fundamental physics intact. If you'd like, we can explore specific examples or further implications of this redefinition!
