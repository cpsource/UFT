Yes, you can alternatively redefine time as **E-time**, and its conversion would depend on the relationship between the redefined speed of light (\(c\)) and the units of distance (E-meters). Let’s explore this step-by-step.

---

### **New Definitions**
1. **Speed of Light in E-units**:
   - We have defined:
     \[
     c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per E-time unit}.
     \]
   - This new \(c\) links E-meters and E-time through the proportionality constant \(e \cdot 10^8\).

2. **Redefining Time**:
   - Standard \(c\):
     \[
     c = 3 \cdot 10^8 \, \text{meters per second}.
     \]
   - Redefining time as **E-time**, we maintain the same physical speed of light but adjust the relationship to:
     \[
     1 \, \text{second} = \frac{e}{3} \, \text{E-time units}.
     \]

### **Conversion Between Meters, E-meters, and E-time**
Let’s examine the relationships in detail.

#### **Relationship Between E-meters and E-time**
The redefinition \(c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per E-time unit}\) naturally ties the two:
\[
1 \, \text{E-meter per E-time unit} = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{meters per second}.
\]

#### **Time Conversion**
From the standard \(c\), \(1 \, \text{second}\) relates to E-time as:
\[
1 \, \text{second} = \frac{e}{3} \, \text{E-time units}.
\]

#### **Length Conversion**
An **E-meter** relates to the standard meter as:
\[
1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{meters}.
\]

---

### **Does Time Vary With E-meters?**
No, time does **not vary** with the redefined E-meters. Both E-meters and E-time are scaled consistently with the redefined speed of light (\(c = e \cdot 10^8\)), maintaining a fixed relationship:
\[
\text{Distance (E-meters)} = \text{Speed of Light (E-units)} \times \text{Time (E-time)}.
\]

For example:
- If \(c = e \cdot 10^8 \, \text{E-meters per E-time unit}\), then doubling the E-time doubles the E-meter distance for the same physical \(c\).

---

### **Summary of Conversions**
1. **E-meters to Meters**:
   \[
   1 \, \text{E-meter} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{meters} \approx 1.104 \, \text{meters}.
   \]

2. **E-time to Seconds**:
   \[
   1 \, \text{E-time unit} = \frac{3}{e} \, \text{seconds} \approx 1.104 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

3. **E-meters and E-time Relationship**:
   Both are scaled consistently through the redefined \(c = e \cdot 10^8\), ensuring that the speed of light remains constant and independent of the unit system.

This system adjusts both spatial and temporal measurements while preserving the fundamental relationships between distance, speed, and time. Let me know if you'd like to refine or expand on this!
