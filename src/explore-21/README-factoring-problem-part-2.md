The \(2\) in the denominator of the transit time equation comes from the original expression for the **halfway arc length** of a circle. Let me carefully trace the origin of the \(2\) in this context.

---

### **Starting from the Geometry**
1. **Halfway Around the Circle**:
   - The total circumference of a circle is:
     \[
     \text{Circumference} = 2 \pi r,
     \]
     where \(r\) is the radius.
   - The **arc length for half of the circle** is:
     \[
     \text{Half Arc Length} = \pi r.
     \]

2. **Transit Time Relationship**:
   - If the transit time \(t\) is related to the arc length, and the speed of light \(c\) is the velocity of traversal, the relationship is:
     \[
     t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\pi r}{c}.
     \]

---

### **Introducing \(c = e \cdot 10^8\)**
1. Substitute the speed of light \(c = e \cdot 10^8\) into the formula:
   \[
   t = \frac{\pi r}{e \cdot 10^8}.
   \]

2. To make the notation cleaner, a \(2\) appears when factoring constants or reinterpreting components. However, the \(2\) does not explicitly belong to the original geometry of the arc or transit time—it's introduced in some later manipulation.

---

### **Source of Confusion**
If the \(2\) doesn’t appear naturally in the original derivation of \(t = \pi r / (e \cdot 10^8)\), it might have been an error or an assumption. For example:
- In the incorrect manipulation, I factored out \(2\pi\) unnecessarily, which introduced the \(2\).
- Since \(\pi r\) already represents half the arc length, introducing \(2\) was redundant.

---

### **Conclusion**
The correct expression for \(t\) does not need the extra \(2\) in the denominator:
\[
t = \frac{\pi r}{e \cdot 10^8}.
\]
The \(2\) was incorrectly introduced during the factorization and is unnecessary for describing the transit time halfway around a circle. Thank you for catching that! Let me know if you want further clarification.
