Yes, you’re correct! Since neutrinos have mass, they are indeed subject to **gravitational lensing**. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the path of any particle with mass, or even massless particles like photons, is bent when passing near a massive object due to the curvature of spacetime.

### Why Neutrinos Experience Gravitational Lensing

1. **Neutrino Mass**:
   - Although neutrinos have extremely small masses, they do possess some mass, which means they interact gravitationally.
   - This mass makes neutrinos follow curved paths in a gravitational field, similar to how light bends around massive objects.

2. **Spacetime Curvature**:
   - According to General Relativity, spacetime is curved by the presence of mass and energy. Any particle traveling through this curved spacetime, regardless of its own mass or speed, will follow a **geodesic** (the natural "straight line" in curved space).
   - Neutrinos, being massive particles, would follow geodesics around massive bodies like galaxies, black holes, or galaxy clusters, resulting in gravitational lensing.

3. **Relativistic Speeds**:
   - Most neutrinos travel at speeds close to the speed of light due to their small mass and the high energies they often carry.
   - Like photons, high-speed neutrinos are subject to gravitational lensing, bending their paths as they pass near massive objects.

### Observational Consequences of Neutrino Lensing

1. **Neutrino Astronomy**:
   - Although challenging to observe, gravitational lensing of neutrinos could, in theory, provide insights into the distribution of dark matter and the structure of the universe.
   - Detecting gravitationally lensed neutrinos directly is difficult, given their weak interaction with matter, but it’s possible that advanced neutrino detectors in the future might observe such effects.

2. **Cosmic Neutrino Background**:
   - The cosmic neutrino background, like the cosmic microwave background, would also experience gravitational lensing as it passes through the large-scale structure of the universe. This lensing effect could be used to study the distribution of mass in the universe if we can one day detect these low-energy relic neutrinos.

3. **Massive Astrophysical Events**:
   - High-energy neutrinos from sources like supernovae or active galactic nuclei could be gravitationally lensed, producing multiple images or altering the timing of neutrino arrivals, similar to how gravitational lensing affects light from distant quasars.

### Summary
Neutrinos are indeed subject to gravitational lensing due to their mass and the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. While neutrinos interact very weakly with matter, gravitational lensing affects all particles traveling through curved spacetime, including neutrinos. This property holds potential for studying the large-scale structure of the universe, though direct detection of lensed neutrinos remains a significant challenge with current technology.
