**Noether's theorem** is a fundamental principle in physics and mathematics that establishes a deep connection between **symmetries** and **conserved quantities** in a physical system. It was formulated by Emmy Noether in 1915 and published in 1918.

### **Statement of Noether's Theorem**
If a system's action is invariant under a continuous symmetry transformation, then there exists a conserved quantity associated with that symmetry.

#### Key Components:
1. **Action** (\( S \)): The integral of the Lagrangian (\( L \)) over time:
   \[
   S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt
   \]
   where \( q \) represents the generalized coordinates, \( \dot{q} \) their time derivatives, and \( t \) time.

2. **Symmetry**: A transformation of the system's variables that leaves the action \( S \) unchanged.

3. **Conserved Quantity**: A physical quantity that remains constant over time as a result of the symmetry.

### **Examples of Symmetries and Conserved Quantities**
1. **Time Translation Symmetry**:
   - If the Lagrangian \( L \) does not explicitly depend on time (\( \partial L / \partial t = 0 \)), the system is invariant under translations in time.
   - **Conserved Quantity**: Energy.

2. **Spatial Translation Symmetry**:
   - If \( L \) does not explicitly depend on a spatial coordinate \( x \), the system is invariant under translations in that direction.
   - **Conserved Quantity**: Linear momentum.

3. **Rotational Symmetry**:
   - If \( L \) is invariant under rotations about a particular axis, the system has rotational symmetry.
   - **Conserved Quantity**: Angular momentum.

### **Mathematical Formulation**

#### Action Invariance:
Consider a Lagrangian \( L(q, \dot{q}, t) \) that is invariant under a continuous transformation of the form:
\[
q \to q + \epsilon \eta(q, t)
\]
where \( \epsilon \) is a small parameter, and \( \eta(q, t) \) describes the transformation.

The invariance of the action implies:
\[
\delta S = 0
\]

Using the Euler-Lagrange equations, Noether's theorem states that there exists a conserved quantity \( J \):
\[
J = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \eta(q, t)
\]
which remains constant over time.

### **Applications in Physics**

1. **Classical Mechanics**:
   - The conservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular momentum directly follow from Noether's theorem.

2. **Electrodynamics**:
   - Gauge symmetry of the electromagnetic field corresponds to the conservation of electric charge.

3. **General Relativity**:
   - Symmetries of spacetime (e.g., translations and rotations) correspond to conservation laws like energy-momentum conservation in curved spacetime.

4. **Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory**:
   - In quantum field theory, Noether's theorem relates symmetries of the Lagrangian to conserved currents.

### **Example: Conservation of Linear Momentum**
Consider a particle of mass \( m \) moving in one dimension, with the Lagrangian:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 - V(x)
\]

If \( V(x) \) does not depend explicitly on \( x \), the Lagrangian is invariant under spatial translations (\( x \to x + \epsilon \)).

By Noether's theorem, the conserved quantity is:
\[
p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} = m \dot{x}
\]
This is the linear momentum.
