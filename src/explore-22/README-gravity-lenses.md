Yes, **gravity can be "lensed" in the same way photons are lensed by a massive object**. This is because gravitational waves—just like photons—travel through spacetime, which is curved by the presence of mass-energy. Let’s explore why and how this works:

---

### 1. **Gravitational Lensing Explained**
Gravitational lensing occurs when mass curves spacetime, bending the paths of objects or signals (e.g., photons) traveling through it. This effect is described by **general relativity**, which tells us that:
\[
\text{Mass-energy tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells objects how to move.}
\]

- When light passes near a massive object (e.g., a galaxy or black hole), its path bends because spacetime is curved.
- This effect is **not unique to light**. Any wave or particle traveling through spacetime will experience the same curvature.

### 2. **Lensing of Gravitational Waves**
Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime itself, propagating at the speed of light. Since they travel along geodesics (the "straight lines" of curved spacetime), their paths are also bent by massive objects:
- Massive objects act as **gravitational lenses** for gravitational waves, just as they do for photons.
- Gravitational waves can be **focused, magnified, or distorted** by the curvature of spacetime caused by intervening mass.

#### Observational Evidence:
- Lensed gravitational waves have been predicted theoretically and are expected to be observed by advanced gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and future observatories (e.g., LISA).
- Multiple images, delays, or distortions of the same gravitational wave signal could indicate lensing.

### 3. **Why Both Photons and Gravitational Waves Are Lensed**
Both photons and gravitational waves are massless and travel at \(c\), making them equally subject to spacetime curvature. The similarities include:
- **Travel Along Geodesics**: Both follow the shortest path in curved spacetime.
- **Affected by Gravitational Potential**: Both experience bending when passing near a massive object.
- **Energy Conservation**: Both can experience redshift or blueshift as they climb out of or fall into gravitational wells.

### 4. **Key Differences Between Photon and Gravity Lensing**
While both phenomena are similar, there are subtle differences due to the nature of gravitational waves:
1. **Wavelength**:
   - Gravitational waves typically have much longer wavelengths (kilometers to light-years) compared to photons (nanometers to millimeters). This means:
     - Gravitational wave lensing is less sensitive to small-scale structures in the lensing mass (e.g., individual stars), while photon lensing is.
     - Gravitational waves interact primarily with large-scale features like galaxy clusters.
   
2. **Nature of the Waves**:
   - Photons are oscillations in the electromagnetic field.
   - Gravitational waves are oscillations in spacetime itself. This may lead to differences in how they interact with extremely strong fields, such as those near black holes.

3. **Detection Challenges**:
   - Gravitational waves are harder to detect than photons, and observing lensing effects in gravitational waves requires extremely precise measurements.

### 5. **In the Context of Your UFT**
In your **Unified Field Theory (UFT)**, where gravity is described as wave functions emitted by mass:
- The lensing of gravitational waves could be interpreted as **interactions between the wave functions of the massive object and the propagating gravitational wave**.
- The gravitational wave’s path is altered by the curvature induced by the emitting mass’s wave functions, similar to how photons interact with the electromagnetic field in spacetime.
- The model could help unify the behavior of all massless wave phenomena (photons, gravitons, etc.) under a single framework.

---

### 6. **Implications and Future Observations**
- Gravitational wave lensing could provide new ways to study the distribution of mass in the universe, including dark matter.
- If your theory suggests subtle differences in how gravitational waves interact with spacetime compared to photons, these differences could manifest in the details of the lensing patterns and might even offer a way to test your theory.

### Conclusion
Gravity is indeed "lensed" just like photons when passing by a massive object, as both follow the curvature of spacetime. The lensing of gravitational waves, already predicted by general relativity, aligns with your UFT framework, where gravity and light are unified under the dynamics of wave functions propagating through curved spacetime. Observing lensed gravitational waves could provide further insights into the nature of spacetime and gravitational interactions.
