This is a fascinating question that touches on the fundamental nature of **gravity** and **electromagnetic radiation**, and the differences between how these forces behave.

### 1. **Why Light Can Be Emitted in a Certain Direction**
Light is an oscillation in the **electromagnetic field**, and its directional emission depends on:
- **Source Characteristics**:
  - An accelerating charge, such as an electron oscillating in an antenna, produces electromagnetic waves in specific directions.
  - The shape, motion, and geometry of the source determine the directionality of the emitted radiation.
- **Dipole Radiation**:
  - Light often exhibits **dipole radiation**, meaning it is emitted preferentially in certain directions due to the motion of the charges (e.g., oscillations or circular motion).
  - Example: A laser emits highly directional light due to the coherent and collimated nature of its source.

### 2. **How Gravity is Emitted: A Key Difference**
Gravity, in contrast, is fundamentally different from electromagnetism in how it behaves:
- **Mass vs. Charge**:
  - Light is produced by oscillating charges. Gravity is produced by the motion and interactions of **mass and energy**.
- **Nature of the Source**:
  - The gravitational field is described by the curvature of spacetime, as governed by **Einstein's general relativity**. A static mass creates a spherically symmetric gravitational field, and there is no preferred direction for emission in this case.
- **No Dipole Radiation**:
  - Gravitational radiation (gravitational waves) is typically **quadrupole radiation**, not dipole:
    - Dipole radiation requires a separation of positive and negative charges. Since gravity has no "negative mass," dipole-like behavior is absent.
    - Quadrupole radiation arises from changes in the shape of a mass distribution, such as two orbiting bodies.

#### Example:
- A binary system of black holes emits gravitational waves predominantly along specific planes (the orbital plane), but the waves themselves radiate out symmetrically in all directions.

### 3. **Can Gravity Be Directional?**
In certain cases, gravity can exhibit directionality:
- **Gravitational Waves**:
  - Generated by asymmetric motion of masses (e.g., mergers of black holes or neutron stars), gravitational waves carry energy away in specific directions.
  - The directionality is dictated by the dynamics of the source, such as the orientation of a binary system.

- **Localized Gravitational Effects**:
  - If a mass distribution is non-spherical, the gravitational field around it can have directional components (e.g., a rotating, flattened disk-like galaxy).

- **Relativity and Frame-Dragging**:
  - A rotating massive object (like Earth) can create **frame-dragging** effects, where spacetime itself is twisted in a specific direction, creating directional gravitational effects (e.g., Lense-Thirring effect).

### 4. **Unified Field Theory (UFT) Perspective**
In your UFT, where gravity is described as **wave functions emitted by mass**, directionality could emerge naturally under specific conditions:
- **Wave Interference**:
  - The wave functions of gravity could interfere constructively or destructively, creating regions of stronger or weaker gravitational effects in specific directions.
- **Mass Movement**:
  - Accelerating or rotating mass distributions could produce directional wave patterns, analogous to how electromagnetic waves are emitted directionally by oscillating charges.
- **Anisotropic Sources**:
  - In your theory, anisotropic (non-uniform) wave emissions could arise from mass configurations that are not symmetrical, creating a directional gravitational signature.

### 5. **Why Gravity Doesn't Behave Like Light in Most Cases**
The lack of directionality in gravity compared to light arises because:
- **Mass Interacts Differently**:
  - Gravity is always attractive and has no "negative mass" counterpart, so it lacks the dipole-like behavior common in electromagnetic interactions.
- **Field vs. Radiation**:
  - The static gravitational field (from a stationary mass) is inherently spherically symmetric, while electromagnetic fields from charges can have preferred directions due to charge oscillations.
- **Wave Nature is Subtle**:
  - Gravitational waves are directional, but they are much weaker and harder to detect than light, making their directional properties less apparent.

---

### 6. **A Thought Experiment: Designing Directional Gravity**
If we imagine a system where gravity could be emitted in a specific direction, it might involve:
1. **Rotating Mass Distributions**:
   - Imagine a system where mass is oscillating asymmetrically, such as a rapidly spinning dumbbell-shaped object.
   - This could generate gravitational waves with a preferential direction.

2. **Localized Interactions**:
   - If gravity is described by wave functions in your UFT, carefully arranged masses could create **constructive interference** in a specific direction.

---

### Conclusion
Gravity is typically emitted symmetrically, but under specific circumstances, such as the generation of gravitational waves by asymmetric mass motion, it can exhibit directionality. This is less apparent than with light due to the absence of dipole-like sources and the inherently weak nature of gravitational interactions. In your UFT, gravity's wave nature could provide mechanisms for directional emission through interference patterns or specific mass configurations.
