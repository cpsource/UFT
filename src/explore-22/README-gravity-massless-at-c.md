Yes, **gravity travels at the speed of light, \(c\)**, and this is consistent with the fact that the **gravitational interaction is mediated by a massless particle, the graviton**, in quantum field theory.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and implications:

---

### 1. **Gravity Propagates at \(c\): Evidence from General Relativity**
In Einstein's **general relativity**, changes in the gravitational field—such as those caused by the motion of massive objects—propagate as **gravitational waves** at the speed of light (\(c\)).

#### Evidence for \(c\):
- **Gravitational Waves Detection**:
   - Gravitational waves, predicted by general relativity, were directly detected by LIGO in 2015. These waves propagate at the speed of light, as shown by events like the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars.
- **Binary Pulsars**:
   - Observations of binary pulsars (e.g., the Hulse-Taylor binary) reveal energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, consistent with the propagation of gravity at \(c\).

#### Why \(c\)?:
- In general relativity, gravity is described by spacetime curvature. The equations governing gravitational waves are derived from Einstein's field equations and are similar to the wave equations for light. Solutions to these equations propagate at \(c\).

---

### 2. **Masslessness of the Graviton**
The fact that gravity propagates at \(c\) implies that its mediating particle, the **graviton**, must be massless. Here's why:

#### Speed of Massless vs. Massive Particles:
- **Massless Particles**: Travel at \(c\). Examples include photons (mediating electromagnetic force) and, theoretically, gravitons (mediating gravity).
- **Massive Particles**: Travel at speeds less than \(c\), depending on their energy.

#### The Graviton:
- In quantum field theory, forces are mediated by exchange particles:
  - Electromagnetic force: Photon (massless).
  - Weak nuclear force: \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons (massive).
  - Gravity: Graviton (massless, spin-2 particle in theory).

- If the graviton had mass:
  - Gravitational waves would propagate at less than \(c\).
  - This would lead to observable deviations from general relativity, such as changes in gravitational wave timing. Such deviations have not been detected.

---

### 3. **Implications of Gravity Being Massless**
#### Long-Range Interaction:
- Massless particles mediate **long-range interactions**. This is why gravity, like electromagnetism, has an infinite range, while forces mediated by massive particles (e.g., weak nuclear force) are short-range.

#### Weakness of Gravity:
- The weakness of gravity compared to other forces is not directly due to the masslessness of the graviton but is related to the strength of the gravitational coupling constant.

---

### 4. **What About Energy and Momentum?**
Although gravitons are massless, they carry **energy and momentum**:
- Gravitational waves can transfer energy to objects, as observed in LIGO detections.
- The energy of a gravitational wave is carried by the collective behavior of spacetime curvature, not by individual particles with mass.

---

### 5. **Your Unified Field Theory Context**
In the context of your **Unified Field Theory (UFT)**:
- If gravity is described as a wave function emitted by mass:
   - The masslessness of the wave carrier aligns with the idea of gravitational waves propagating at \(c\).
   - In this framework, the interaction between gravitational wave functions could emerge naturally from the massless nature of their mediator.

- The wave functions could represent the **geometry of spacetime**, with gravity arising as an emergent phenomenon from their interactions.

---

### Conclusion
Gravity indeed propagates at \(c\), consistent with general relativity and gravitational wave observations. This requires that its mediator, the graviton, is massless. The masslessness ensures gravity's long-range nature and its behavior as a relativistic force. Your UFT can incorporate these principles by treating gravity as a manifestation of massless wave interactions in spacetime.
