The total energy carried off by the Big Bang is a complex question, and the answer depends on how we interpret "energy" within the framework of cosmology and general relativity. Here's an overview:

---

### 1. **Energy Conservation in General Relativity**:
- In general relativity, the concept of "total energy" of the universe is tricky because energy conservation applies differently compared to classical mechanics. 
- The universe's expansion and the curvature of spacetime make defining a global, conserved "total energy" problematic.

---

### 2. **Energy of the Observable Universe**:
- **Matter**: The mass-energy of all matter in the observable universe is estimated to be about \(10^{53}\) kg, which translates to:
  \[
  E = mc^2 \implies E \sim 10^{70} \, \text{joules}.
  \]
- **Radiation**: The energy carried by photons in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is much smaller than matter energy, about \(10^{69}\) joules.
- **Dark Energy**: The majority of the energy in the universe (~68%) is thought to reside in dark energy, associated with the cosmological constant, but its total energy depends on the universe's size.

---

### 3. **Dark Energy's Contribution**:
- Dark energy density (\(\rho_\Lambda\)) is approximately \(6.91 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{joules/m}^3\).
- The observable universe has a volume of about \(4.1 \times 10^{80} \, \text{m}^3\), so:
  \[
  E_\text{dark energy} = \rho_\Lambda \times V \sim 2.8 \times 10^{71} \, \text{joules}.
  \]

---

### 4. **Gravitational Energy**:
- The gravitational potential energy of the universe is negative and counteracts some of the positive energy contributions. This is crucial because, in many cosmological models, the total energy (positive and negative) of the universe may sum to **zero**.

---

### 5. **Inflation and the Big Bang**:
- During the Big Bang and cosmic inflation, energy existed in a highly condensed form (potential energy of the inflaton field).
- After inflation ended, this energy transformed into the hot, dense state of the early universe (radiation and matter). While the exact value of this energy is uncertain, it seeded the entire observable universe.

---

### 6. **Infinite or Finite Universe?**
- If the universe is infinite, the total energy might also be infinite.
- If the universe is finite (e.g., if it has a closed geometry), then the total energy would be finite and constrained by its size.

---

### Approximate Total Energy of the Observable Universe:
Adding contributions:
1. Matter: \(10^{70} \, \text{joules}\),
2. Radiation: \(10^{69} \, \text{joules}\),
3. Dark energy: \(10^{71} \, \text{joules}\).

The **total energy** in the observable universe today is dominated by **dark energy**, approximately **\(10^{71}\) joules**.

---

This estimate only applies to the observable universe and does not account for regions beyond our cosmic horizon. Additionally, any attempt to quantify "total energy" must consider the nuances of energy in an expanding universe.
