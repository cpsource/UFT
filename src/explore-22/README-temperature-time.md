Yes, temperature is indeed related to the motion of particles, though it's a bit more nuanced than simply velocity. Here's how:

### Temperature and Motion:
1. **Kinetic Energy of Particles**:
   - In a physical system, temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles. 
   - For gases, the kinetic energy of molecules is directly proportional to temperature:
     \[
     \text{Average kinetic energy} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T
     \]
     where \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant and \(T\) is the temperature.

2. **Velocity of Particles**:
   - The kinetic energy depends on the velocity of the particles:
     \[
     KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
     \]
   - Higher temperatures correspond to faster-moving particles (higher velocities on average). However, temperature doesn't measure individual particle velocities but rather their statistical distribution.

3. **Temperature as a Statistical Measure**:
   - Temperature reflects the collective behavior of particles rather than the motion of a single particle.
   - Even in a system where some particles are stationary and others move quickly, the temperature represents the average kinetic energy across all particles.

### Energy from the Big Bang:
When thinking about the energy carried off from the Big Bang:
- Initially, this energy was in a highly condensed and uniform state. As the universe expanded, the energy spread out.
- The **cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB)** is the "leftover heat" from the Big Bang and can be measured as a temperature (currently ~2.7 K).
- This "temperature" corresponds to the energy of photons (light particles) and their wavelengths, which have stretched due to the universe's expansion.

### Does Temperature Measure Velocity? 
- Indirectly, yes. Temperature correlates with the velocity (or energy) of particles in the system.
- However, velocity in this context is random and chaotic (thermal motion), not directional or systematic like the velocity of a car or a planet.

So, in summary:
- Temperature is a measure of the **average energy** of microscopic motion (including velocity components) in a system.
- For the energy from the Big Bang, the "temperature" we measure reflects the distribution of photon energies rather than the velocities of individual particles in a straightforward sense.
