This is a fascinating question that delves into the nature of **light** and the concept of **proper time** in relativity. Let's break it down:

---

### **Key Points About Proper Time and Light**
1. **What is Proper Time?**
   - Proper time (\(\tau\)) is the time measured by a clock that travels along a specific worldline. It is the time experienced by an object moving through spacetime.
   - For light, which travels at the speed of light (\(c\)), the proper time along its trajectory is always **zero**.

2. **Why is Light's Proper Time Always Zero?**
   - In relativity, the spacetime interval for light is **null**:
     \[
     ds^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 = 0.
     \]
   - This implies \(d\tau = 0\) for light, meaning it does not experience the passage of time.

3. **Implication for Light's Journey**
   - From the light's perspective (if such a perspective existed), the emission and absorption events are **instantaneous**. No time passes for light, regardless of the distance it travels.

---

### **Observer Perspective: Travel Time**
1. **Observer 1 (O1) at 1 Light-Year**
   - Observer 1 will see the light arrive in **1 year** (as measured by their clock in their inertial frame).

2. **Observer 2 (O2) at 2 Light-Years**
   - Observer 2 will see the light arrive in **2 years** (as measured by their clock in their inertial frame).

3. **Difference in Travel Time**
   - From the perspective of any stationary observer in spacetime, the light takes longer to reach a more distant observer. However, this is **coordinate time** (measured in the observer's frame), not proper time.

---

### **Reconciling the Paradox**
- Proper time for light is always \(0\), regardless of the distance traveled.
- The reason this does not conflict with the travel time observed by O1 and O2 is that proper time and coordinate time are fundamentally different concepts:
  - **Coordinate time** is the time measured by an external observer's clock.
  - **Proper time** is intrinsic to the worldline of the object being measured (in this case, light).
- Light, by its very nature, does not experience time; thus, its proper time remains zero, even if it "travels" vast distances in coordinate time.

---

### **Intuitive Explanation**
Imagine light as a "timeless messenger." While observers (O1 and O2) measure different durations for the light to reach them, the light itself experiences no passage of time. The "distance" it travels is a feature of the spacetime geometry as seen by the observers, not of light's own experience.

This highlights the unique nature of light and the fundamental difference between proper time and coordinate time in relativistic physics.
