### Michelson-Morley Experiment

The **Michelson-Morley experiment** (1887) was a famous attempt to detect the presence of the "luminiferous aether"—a theoretical medium through which light was believed to propagate. At that time, it was thought that if light traveled as a wave, it would need a medium, like sound requires air or water requires molecules. The goal was to measure the Earth's motion relative to this supposed aether.

#### Setup
The experiment used an **interferometer**, which splits a single light beam into two beams that travel at right angles to each other. One beam travels in the direction of the Earth's motion through space, and the other beam travels perpendicular to it. When the beams are recombined, they should produce an interference pattern based on any difference in speed (due to the aether) along the two paths.

#### Findings
Surprisingly, Michelson and Morley found **no significant difference in the speed of light** along the two paths, regardless of the Earth’s direction of motion. This null result contradicted the aether theory and suggested that the speed of light is constant in all directions. This finding laid a cornerstone for **Einstein’s theory of special relativity**, which postulates that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.

### The Double-Slit Experiment with Photons

The **double-slit experiment** is one of the most iconic experiments in quantum physics, illustrating the wave-particle duality of light and other particles, such as electrons.

#### Setup
The experiment involves shooting photons (particles of light) one at a time at a barrier with two narrow, parallel slits. A screen is placed behind the barrier to detect the photons that pass through the slits.

1. When **both slits are open** and photons are fired one at a time, an **interference pattern** emerges on the screen—alternating bands of light and dark.
2. The interference pattern suggests that each photon is interfering with itself, behaving as if it were a wave that passed through both slits simultaneously.

#### Wave-Particle Duality
The result is puzzling because if light were purely a particle, we would expect two bright bands on the screen, each corresponding to photons passing through one of the slits. Instead, the interference pattern suggests that **light behaves as a wave**, with each photon taking all possible paths and interfering with itself.

However, if we place detectors at the slits to observe which slit each photon goes through, the interference pattern disappears. This collapse of the interference pattern when observed suggests that photons exhibit **particle-like behavior** when measured. Thus, photons exhibit **wave-particle duality**: they act as waves in certain conditions and as particles in others.

### The Duality of Light as Both a Point and a Wave

The **wave-particle duality of light** is one of the most profound ideas in quantum mechanics, suggesting that light (and other quantum particles) does not fit neatly into classical definitions of waves or particles but instead displays properties of both.

1. **Wave Nature**:
   - The wave nature of light is evident in phenomena like interference and diffraction. In the double-slit experiment, the interference pattern demonstrates the wave properties of light, as the alternating bands can only be explained by wave interference.

2. **Particle Nature**:
   - The particle nature of light is evident in experiments like the photoelectric effect, where light behaves as if it consists of discrete packets (photons). Each photon has a specific amount of energy related to its frequency, and it can be thought of as a "point" when it interacts with electrons.

3. **Quantum Interpretation**:
   - Quantum mechanics provides a framework to understand this duality. According to **quantum theory**, particles like photons are described by **wave functions**, which represent probabilities. The wave function spreads out across space, suggesting that particles do not have a definite position until measured.
   - When an observation or measurement is made, the wave function "collapses" to a single position or state, revealing the particle-like property of the photon.

### Summary

The Michelson-Morley experiment and the double-slit experiment both challenge the classical view of light. The Michelson-Morley experiment helped to discard the idea of aether and supported the theory that the speed of light is constant, a fundamental principle in special relativity. The double-slit experiment reveals the wave-particle duality of light, which behaves as a wave when unobserved and as a particle when measured. This duality defies classical intuition and is a central mystery of quantum mechanics, suggesting that light (and all particles) does not conform to being purely a wave or a point but instead embodies aspects of both.
