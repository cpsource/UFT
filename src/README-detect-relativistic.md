When considering **relativistic effects** in the scenario where \( p_1 \) (with mass \( m_1 \)) is accelerating, the relationship between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) becomes more complex. Relativity introduces time dilation, length contraction, and other effects that alter the way an observer at \( p_2 \) would perceive the gravitational influence and motion of \( p_1 \). Hereâ€™s an analysis of these effects:

### 1. **Relativistic Effects of Accelerating Mass \( m_1 \)**
- **Time Dilation**: As \( p_1 \) accelerates away from \( p_2 \), an observer at \( p_2 \) would perceive the clock at \( p_1 \) as running more slowly due to time dilation. This effect increases as the velocity of \( p_1 \) approaches the speed of light \( c \).
- **Length Contraction**: If \( p_1 \) is accelerating along a vector that takes it away from \( p_2 \), the observer at \( p_2 \) would see the length of \( p_1 \)'s path contracted in the direction of motion. This effect is significant only at relativistic speeds.
- **Gravitational Redshift**: If \( p_1 \) emits any signals (such as gravitational waves), they would be redshifted as \( p_1 \) accelerates away from \( p_2 \). This redshift occurs because the energy of the signal decreases as \( p_1 \) moves away, resulting in lower-frequency detection at \( p_2 \).

### 2. **Gravitational Field as Perceived at \( p_2 \)**
- **Relativistic Gravitational Field**: The gravitational field generated by \( m_1 \) will appear different to \( p_2 \) when \( m_1 \) is moving at relativistic speeds. The field will be affected by both the velocity and the acceleration of \( m_1 \).
- **Gravitational Effects Due to Acceleration**:
  - If \( m_1 \) is accelerating away from \( p_2 \), the gravitational field at \( p_2 \) would decrease over time as \( m_1 \) moves further away.
  - The gravitational field produced by a moving mass at relativistic speeds is described by the **relativistic generalization of Newtonian gravity**, which includes modifications from general relativity. These modifications take into account the increased mass-energy due to motion.

### 3. **Relativistic Momentum and Energy Considerations**
- **Relativistic Mass Increase**: As \( m_1 \) approaches relativistic speeds, its relativistic mass (or total energy) increases according to:
  \[
  m_{\text{rel}} = \frac{m_1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \]
  where \( v \) is the velocity of \( m_1 \) and \( c \) is the speed of light.
- **Energy Emission and Gravitational Waves**: If \( m_1 \) is accelerating, it can emit gravitational waves, but the intensity and frequency of these waves would be affected by the relativistic increase in energy and redshift due to acceleration away from \( p_2 \).

### 4. **Relativistic Effects on Gravitational Waves**
- **Directional Dependence**: The direction in which \( m_1 \) is accelerating (away from or toward \( p_2 \)) affects how gravitational waves propagate. If \( m_1 \) accelerates away from \( p_2 \), the gravitational waves emitted would appear to have a lower amplitude and frequency due to redshift as perceived at \( p_2 \).
- **Quadrupole Moment Change**: The generation of gravitational waves depends on the change in the quadrupole moment. For an observer at \( p_2 \), if \( m_1 \) is accelerating along a vector away from \( p_2 \), the rate of change of the quadrupole moment would appear reduced due to the relative motion.

### 5. **Mathematical Representation**
- **Gravitational Field**:
  For a mass \( m_1 \) moving at relativistic speeds with acceleration, the gravitational field at \( p_2 \) can be described by:
  \[
  g_{\text{rel}} = \frac{G m_{\text{rel}}}{r^2} \left(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^{-3/2}
  \]
  where \( m_{\text{rel}} \) is the relativistic mass, \( v \) is the velocity vector of \( m_1 \), and \( r \) is the distance between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \).
- **Gravitational Wave Strain**:
  The strain \( h \) at \( p_2 \) from an accelerating mass \( m_1 \) would be modified by the relativistic Doppler effect:
  \[
  h_{\text{rel}} \approx h_0 \left(1 - \frac{v \cdot \hat{r}}{c}\right)
  \]
  where \( h_0 \) is the non-relativistic strain, \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector in the direction from \( p_1 \) to \( p_2 \), and \( v \) is the velocity vector of \( m_1 \).

### 6. **Observational Implications at \( p_2 \)**
- **Time Delay and Light Travel Time**: If \( m_1 \) is accelerating away from \( p_2 \), there will be an increasing time delay in the arrival of any signals or changes in the gravitational field due to the increased distance over time.
- **Perception of Motion**: The acceleration of \( m_1 \) along an arbitrary vector could cause \( p_2 \) to perceive changes in the gravitational field strength and direction. These changes would be further modified by relativistic effects such as time dilation and redshift.

### 7. **Practical Detection at \( p_2 \)**
- **Redshifted Gravitational Waves**: If gravitational waves are emitted, their frequency would be redshifted as \( m_1 \) accelerates away from \( p_2 \). The observer at \( p_2 \) would detect waves with a longer wavelength and lower frequency.
- **Relativistic Aberration**: The direction of any radiation or gravitational waves emitted by \( m_1 \) would appear shifted due to the relativistic effect known as **aberration of light**, which also applies to gravitational waves at high velocities.

### Summary
- **Relativistic Acceleration**: When \( m_1 \) accelerates away from \( p_2 \), an observer at \( p_2 \) would detect changes in the gravitational field that are modified by relativistic effects such as time dilation, redshift, and relativistic mass increase.
- **Gravitational Wave Detection**: If \( m_1 \) emits gravitational waves while accelerating, these waves would be redshifted, and their amplitude would be affected by the relative motion.
- **Complex Effects**: The precise effects depend on the velocity and acceleration vectors of \( m_1 \) relative to \( p_2 \). The greater the velocity of \( m_1 \), the more pronounced the relativistic effects will be.

This scenario combines elements of **general relativity** (gravitational field behavior and gravitational waves) with **special relativity** (relativistic motion, time dilation, and redshift), making it complex to model precisely but rich in theoretical implications.
