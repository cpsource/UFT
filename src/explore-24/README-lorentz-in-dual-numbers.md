To express the **Lorentz transformation** using **dual numbers**, we need to map the spacetime coordinates and the Lorentz transformation equations into the dual number framework. Here's the step-by-step process:

---

### 1. **What are Dual Numbers?**
Dual numbers are of the form:

\[
z = a + b\epsilon
\]
where:
- \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers,
- \(\epsilon\) is a nilpotent element (\(\epsilon^2 = 0\)).

Dual numbers extend real numbers by incorporating an infinitesimal component \(b\epsilon\). They are commonly used in automatic differentiation and have applications in expressing certain linear transformations, including the Lorentz transformation.

---

### 2. **Lorentz Transformation in Standard Form**
The Lorentz transformation for a boost in the \(x\)-direction is given by:
\[
t' = \gamma (t - \frac{v}{c}x), \quad x' = \gamma (x - vt), \quad y' = y, \quad z' = z
\]
where:
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\) is the Lorentz factor,
- \(v\) is the relative velocity,
- \(c\) is the speed of light.

---

### 3. **Mapping Lorentz Transformation with Dual Numbers**
In the dual number framework, we encode the coordinates and velocity as dual numbers:
- Define spacetime coordinates as:
  \[
  z = x + t\epsilon
  \]
  where \(x\) is the spatial coordinate, and \(t\) is the time coordinate.
  
- Velocity \(v\) is represented as a dual number:
  \[
  \beta = \frac{v}{c} + \epsilon
  \]

- The Lorentz transformation is expressed as a transformation of \(z\):
  \[
  z' = \Lambda z
  \]

---

### 4. **Dual Number Representation of Lorentz Boost**
The Lorentz boost can be expressed as a matrix acting on dual numbers:

\[
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix}
\gamma & -\beta \gamma \\
-\beta \gamma & \gamma
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Applying this to the dual number \(z = x + t\epsilon\):
\[
z' = \gamma (x - \frac{v}{c}t) + \gamma (t - \frac{v}{c}x)\epsilon
\]

Expanding this:
- The spatial component:
  \[
  x' = \gamma (x - \frac{v}{c}t)
  \]
- The time component:
  \[
  t' = \gamma (t - \frac{v}{c}x)
  \]

The dual number representing the transformed coordinates is:
\[
z' = x' + t'\epsilon
\]

---

### 5. **Advantages of Using Dual Numbers**
Using dual numbers:
- Encodes both space and time coordinates in a single entity,
- Provides a compact way to represent Lorentz transformations as operations on dual numbers,
- Exploits the algebraic structure of dual numbers (\(\epsilon^2 = 0\)) to naturally handle the linear relationship between space and time in special relativity.

---

### 6. **Conclusion**
The Lorentz transformation using dual numbers can be written as:
\[
z' = \gamma \left( z - \beta z\epsilon \right)
\]
where \(z = x + t\epsilon\) is the dual number representing spacetime coordinates, and \(\beta = v/c\) encodes the relative velocity. This approach elegantly captures the interplay between space and time in special relativity using the nilpotent property of dual numbers.
