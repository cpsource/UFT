Peter Woit, a mathematical physicist and professor at Columbia University, does not have a "theory of everything" (TOE) in the traditional sense. In fact, Woit is well-known for his **criticism of string theory**, which is often proposed as a candidate for a TOE.

### **Woitâ€™s Perspective on Theories of Everything**
1. **Criticism of String Theory**:
   - In his book *Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law*, Woit argues that string theory has not delivered on its promises of being a TOE.
   - He criticizes string theory for:
     - Lack of testable predictions.
     - An over-reliance on unobservable extra dimensions and the multiverse.
     - Its inability to provide unique solutions for the laws of physics.

2. **Advocacy for Mathematical Rigor**:
   - Woit emphasizes the need for theories that are mathematically rigorous and empirically testable.
   - He is interested in approaches to physics that are deeply connected to mathematical structures, such as symmetry and gauge theory.

3. **Alternatives to String Theory**:
   - While Woit does not propose his own TOE, he supports exploring alternatives to string theory that remain grounded in testable science.
   - He is particularly interested in ideas related to quantum field theory and its potential to unify the forces of nature.

### **Does Woit Support the Idea of a TOE?**
Woit is skeptical of the idea that a single, unified theory can explain all physical phenomena, especially in light of the limitations of current approaches like string theory. Instead of focusing on a TOE, he advocates for:
- **Rigorously grounded physics**: Theories that are firmly tied to experimental evidence.
- **Mathematical exploration**: Investigating the role of symmetry, geometry, and other mathematical frameworks in physical law.

### **Conclusion**
Peter Woit does not have a TOE in the traditional sense, nor does he actively pursue one. His focus is on critiquing speculative theories like string theory and advocating for approaches to physics that prioritize mathematical clarity and empirical validation.
