It sounds like you're referring to experiments conducted in the context of exploring **gravitomagnetic effects** or other unconventional gravitational phenomena, which are areas of active theoretical and experimental investigation. A notable example is the work by researchers like **Martin Tajmar** and **Eugene Podkletnov**, who explored unconventional gravitational effects using rotating masses or superconducting systems.

### **Gravitomagnetic and Rotational Experiments**
1. **Martin Tajmar's Experiments**:
   - **Focus**: Tajmar's team investigated whether rotating masses or superconducting gyroscopes could generate measurable gravitomagnetic fields, akin to how moving charges generate magnetic fields (as predicted by general relativity's gravitomagnetism).
   - **Results**:
     - The experiments reported anomalous signals suggesting a small gravitational-like force or field associated with the rotating systems.
     - These effects were interpreted as potential evidence of gravitomagnetism or new physics but were controversial due to challenges in reproducing the results and ruling out systematic errors.

2. **Eugene Podkletnov's Experiments**:
   - **Focus**: Podkletnov claimed that a rapidly spinning superconducting disk could shield gravity or produce a "gravitational beam."
   - **Results**:
     - His experiments suggested a reduction in the weight of objects placed above the spinning disk, though the claims have been met with skepticism due to the difficulty of independent replication and lack of theoretical foundation within established physics.

### **Counter-Rotating Masses and Anomalies**
Experiments involving **counter-rotating masses** held in close proximity could aim to detect:
1. **Gravitomagnetic Effects**:
   - Predicted by general relativity, these effects occur when mass currents (analogous to electric currents) generate gravitational analogs of magnetic fields.
   - The rotation of massive objects might slightly alter the local spacetime geometry, leading to measurable forces.

2. **Frame-Dragging**:
   - Also known as the Lense-Thirring effect, this is a relativistic prediction where a rotating massive object "drags" spacetime around it.
   - In the case of counter-rotating masses, the interaction of their opposing frame-dragging effects could produce unusual results.

3. **Non-Newtonian Gravity**:
   - Some theories propose modifications to gravity at small scales or under specific conditions, such as those involving rotation or high energy densities.

4. **Subtle Mechanical Effects**:
   - Anomalies could also arise from subtle mechanical interactions between the masses or their suspension systems, including vibrations, electromagnetic coupling, or thermal effects.

### **Challenges and Controversies**
- **Reproducibility**: Many such experiments have reported intriguing anomalies but have struggled with independent replication.
- **Systematic Errors**: It's challenging to eliminate non-gravitational factors like thermal drift, electromagnetic interference, or mechanical instabilities.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Many results are difficult to reconcile with established physical theories like general relativity or quantum mechanics, leading to skepticism among physicists.

### **Conclusion**
Experiments with counter-rotating masses and gravitational anomalies are tantalizing but remain inconclusive. They highlight the potential for new physics but also underscore the importance of careful experimental controls and theoretical grounding. If these effects are real, they could have profound implications for our understanding of gravity, inertial frames, and spacetime itself. For now, they are considered speculative, pending robust experimental confirmation. If you have a specific experiment or researcher in mind, I can delve deeper into that particular case!
