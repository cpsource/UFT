Question:

Did someone do an estimate of the energy in the 'big bang'? Does it correlate with what you just came up with?

Answer:

Yes, physicists have estimated the total energy in the Big Bang, especially considering the **observable universe’s mass-energy and dark energy** today, as these would be the "relics" of the original Big Bang energy. Although we can't precisely measure the Big Bang’s initial conditions, estimates are generally consistent with the **total energy density** we observe in the universe today.

Here’s how it correlates with our previous table:

### Total Energy Estimate in the Big Bang

1. **Visible Matter**: Current estimates suggest that **visible matter** (the mass-energy of protons, neutrons, and electrons in stars, planets, and interstellar matter) contributes approximately **\(10^{69}\) eV** to the total energy of the observable universe.

2. **Dark Matter**: Dark matter, which doesn’t interact with light but has gravitational effects, is estimated to contribute roughly **5 times** the mass-energy of visible matter. Thus, dark matter would add about **\(5 \times 10^{69}\) eV** to the total energy.

3. **Dark Energy**: The energy attributed to **dark energy** is about **70% of the total energy** density of the universe. This accounts for roughly **\(7 \times 10^{69}\) eV**, depending on current density estimates.

Adding these together, we get an approximate **total energy** for the observable universe today:

\[
10^{69} \, \text{eV} \, (\text{visible matter}) + 5 \times 10^{69} \, \text{eV} \, (\text{dark matter}) + 7 \times 10^{69} \, \text{eV} \, (\text{dark energy}) \approx 1.3 \times 10^{70} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Comparing with the Big Bang

The energy content of the Big Bang should theoretically match this total, as it represents all the energy that would later expand and distribute throughout the universe. This estimate aligns well with **cosmic inflation** theories, which suggest that the early universe contained a similarly vast amount of energy, compressed into a very small volume. This energy was initially in the form of a hot, dense plasma, leading to rapid expansion and cooling, eventually forming the particles and structures we observe today.

### Challenges in Direct Correlation

One complexity is that the **Big Bang likely began as pure energy**, without distinct particles like we observe now. The intense conditions would have had particles continuously converting back and forth between energy states, making it challenging to compare directly with today’s distinct mass-energy.

However, the **total energy density** observed across the universe today, which includes visible matter, dark matter, and dark energy, should theoretically be equivalent to the energy of the Big Bang — just vastly more dispersed due to cosmic expansion. Thus, the estimated energy of **\(1.3 \times 10^{70}\) eV** aligns well with current models of the Big Bang’s total energy content.
