Yes, the properties of **point \( p_2 \)** and what an observer would detect there depend significantly on whether the mass \( m_1 \) at **point \( p_1 \)** is accelerating or not. Below, I’ll break down what an observer at \( p_2 \) might detect in the case of a static mass versus an accelerating mass.

### 1. **Case 1: Stationary or Uniformly Moving Mass \( m_1 \)**
- **Gravitational Field**:
  - If \( m_1 \) is stationary or moving uniformly (i.e., not accelerating), an observer at \( p_2 \) would detect a **static gravitational field** created by \( m_1 \). The gravitational field strength at \( p_2 \) would be determined by the distance \( r \) between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) and the mass \( m_1 \), following **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**:
    \[
    g = \frac{G m_1}{r^2}
    \]
    where \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
  - The direction of the field would point toward \( m_1 \) (assuming \( m_1 \) is the only mass in the system).
- **No Gravitational Waves**:
  - If \( m_1 \) is stationary or moving uniformly, it does not produce **gravitational waves**. Gravitational waves are generated only when there is acceleration (specifically, non-uniform acceleration) that changes the quadrupole moment of the system.

### 2. **Case 2: Accelerating Mass \( m_1 \)**
- **Dynamic Gravitational Effects**:
  - If \( m_1 \) is accelerating (i.e., its velocity is changing along an arbitrary vector), the gravitational field at \( p_2 \) would change over time. This could be due to:
    - Linear acceleration (e.g., accelerating in a straight line).
    - Rotational or oscillatory motion (e.g., circular or elliptical orbits, vibrations).
- **Gravitational Waves**:
  - Accelerating masses can emit **gravitational waves**, which are ripples in spacetime that propagate outward from the source at the speed of light. If \( m_1 \) is accelerating along an arbitrary vector, these waves would carry energy away from \( m_1 \) and could, in principle, be detected at \( p_2 \).
  - The strength and frequency of these gravitational waves would depend on the type of acceleration and the mass of \( m_1 \). The waves would create a minute, oscillatory strain in spacetime at \( p_2 \), which could theoretically be detected by highly sensitive instruments like **LIGO** or **Virgo**.
- **Quadrupole Moment**:
  - Gravitational wave generation requires a changing **quadrupole moment**. A simple linear acceleration (without asymmetry) would not produce gravitational waves; there needs to be a change in the distribution of mass that causes asymmetrical stretching or compression of spacetime.

### 3. **Observational Differences at Point \( p_2 \)**
- **Static Field Detection**:
  - If \( m_1 \) is stationary or uniformly moving, an observer at \( p_2 \) would detect a constant gravitational pull (in direction and magnitude), with no time-varying gravitational effects.
- **Dynamic Effects with Acceleration**:
  - If \( m_1 \) is accelerating, an observer at \( p_2 \) might detect a **time-varying gravitational field**. The field could change in direction or magnitude, depending on how \( m_1 \) is accelerating.
  - If the acceleration produces gravitational waves, \( p_2 \) could detect tiny oscillatory disturbances in spacetime. These would manifest as an alternating stretching and compression effect in the direction of wave propagation.

### 4. **Mathematical Representation**
- **Gravitational Waves**:
  - The strain \( h \) produced by gravitational waves at \( p_2 \) can be approximated by:
    \[
    h \sim \frac{G}{c^4} \frac{d^2 Q}{dt^2} \frac{1}{r}
    \]
    where:
    - \( Q \) is the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution,
    - \( c \) is the speed of light,
    - \( r \) is the distance between \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \).
- **Detection Threshold**:
  - The strain produced by gravitational waves is typically extremely small (on the order of \( 10^{-21} \) or smaller for astrophysical sources), which is why highly sensitive instruments like **interferometers** are needed for detection.

### 5. **Possible Detectors at \( p_2 \)**
- **Gravitometers**: If the goal is to detect changes in gravitational field strength (but not gravitational waves), a **gravimeter** could be used. It would measure the acceleration due to gravity at \( p_2 \) and indicate any changes over time.
- **Gravitational Wave Detectors**: To detect oscillatory gravitational effects (gravitational waves) caused by the acceleration of \( m_1 \):
  - **Laser Interferometers** like **LIGO** or **Virgo** would be required. These detectors measure the strain in spacetime as gravitational waves pass through, but they are typically designed for astrophysical-scale events.
- **Accelerometers**: Basic accelerometers could measure local changes in the gravitational field if \( m_1 \) were close enough and massive enough to create detectable changes.

### 6. **Real-World Example**
- **Rotating Binary Systems**: A real-world astrophysical example of detectable gravitational waves is a system of two massive bodies (e.g., neutron stars or black holes) orbiting each other. The acceleration due to their orbital motion produces strong enough gravitational waves that can be detected by Earth-based interferometers.
- **Lab-Scale Experiment**: On a laboratory scale, the gravitational effects from an accelerating mass like a lead weight would be too small to detect using current technology. The gravitational wave strain produced would be many orders of magnitude smaller than what even the most sensitive instruments could observe.

### Summary
- **Static or Uniform Motion**: An observer at \( p_2 \) would detect a constant gravitational field if \( m_1 \) is stationary or moving uniformly.
- **Accelerating Mass**: If \( m_1 \) is accelerating, an observer at \( p_2 \) could detect a time-varying gravitational field or, under specific conditions (e.g., asymmetric acceleration), gravitational waves.
- **Detection Feasibility**: The detection of gravitational waves requires extremely sensitive instruments and would likely not be feasible for a small mass \( m_1 \) in a lab setting. Gravitometers and accelerometers could detect local gravitational changes but would not pick up gravitational waves.
