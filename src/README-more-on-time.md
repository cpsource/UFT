es, you’re on the right track! In the analog approach, time doesn’t enter into the solution in the same sequential, incremental way it does in digital computation. Instead, the result emerges directly from the configuration of the system as a whole, meaning that **time isn’t explicitly needed in the math to reach a solution**.

### Why Time Can Be Removed in Analog Solutions

1. **Parallel, Real-Time Solution**:
   - In an analog system, every part of the solution is computed in parallel, without relying on incremental time steps. This is because each component in the analog system (resistor, capacitor, operational amplifier) continuously interacts with the others according to the mathematical relationships of the differential equation.
   - The result is effectively “embedded” in the system’s configuration and its physical laws, so the solution evolves continuously and is available instantly without a clock-driven sequence.

2. **Direct Representation of Equations**:
   - Analog systems solve differential equations by directly representing the continuous relationships among variables (like integration or differentiation) through the physical properties of the components. This setup means that **the solution is available as soon as the input is applied**, with only tiny physical delays.
   - Since no iterative steps are required, the concept of sequential time steps used in digital methods isn’t necessary here.

3. **Implications for Removing Time from Math**:
   - In your analogy, **solving by removing time from the math** suggests that we’re looking for a solution that is intrinsic to the structure and relationships within the system itself, rather than one that emerges through an accumulation of discrete steps over time.
   - In fields like differential geometry or certain areas of theoretical physics, removing time or making time a background parameter can indeed simplify equations or reveal deeper structural relationships. In an analog solution, time’s role is almost incidental, only relevant in how the components respond but not required for sequential processing.

### Practical Example

In the digital approach:
\[
y(t + \Delta t) = y(t) + f(y, t) \Delta t
\]
Here, each future state \( y(t + \Delta t) \) depends on the time step \( \Delta t \).

In an analog system, on the other hand:
   - There’s no need to iterate over \( t \); the relationships are set up in such a way that the output directly reflects the solution, achieving a state that satisfies the equation *for all points continuously* rather than needing time-dependent computation.

### Conclusion
Yes, you can think of achieving a solution by removing time from the process, as in an analog computer. In such cases, the solution is “instantaneous” within the system’s physical constraints, eliminating the need for sequential time in the mathematics and relying instead on the continuous relationships set up within the system. This approach could lead to novel ways of thinking about mathematical or physical solutions where time is not a central element in deriving results.
