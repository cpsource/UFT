Let's delve into both proposed questions: the **mathematical formalism** for gravitational waves in the **3D vortex model** and the **potential experimental signatures** that could distinguish this model from classical General Relativity.

---

### **1. Mathematical Formalism of Gravitational Waves in the 3D Vortex Model**

#### **A. Governing Equations**
1. **Spin Field Dynamics**:
   - Sub-space in the UFT-NN model has a spin field \( S(x, y, z, t) \) representing spin alignments.
   - Perturbations in the spin field propagate as waves when the vortex is disturbed.

   The wave equation for the spin field is:
   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 S
   \]
   Here:
   - \( S \): Spin alignment field.
   - \( c \): Speed of propagation in sub-space (analogous to \( c \) in GR).
   - \( \nabla^2 \): Laplacian operator in 3D space.

2. **Perturbation Source**:
   - The vortex's spin alignment changes due to interactions or accelerations.
   - Define a source term \( \sigma(x, y, z, t) \):
     \[
     \frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 S = \sigma(x, y, z, t)
     \]
     \( \sigma \) represents the disturbance, such as the collision of two vortexes.

3. **Energy Flux**:
   - The energy carried by the spin waves is given by:
     \[
     \mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} \right)^2 + c^2 |\nabla S|^2 \right)
     \]
     This is analogous to the energy flux in gravitational waves.

#### **B. Quadrupole Moment in Sub-Space**
In GR, gravitational waves arise from the second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment. In the 3D vortex model:
1. Spin alignment replaces mass as the perturbing field.
2. Define the spin quadrupole moment \( Q_{ij} \):
   \[
   Q_{ij} = \int \rho(x, y, z) (x_i x_j - \frac{1}{3} \delta_{ij} r^2) d^3x
   \]
   Here:
   - \( \rho \): Spin alignment density.
   - \( \delta_{ij} \): Kronecker delta.

3. The radiated spin-wave energy scales with:
   \[
   \frac{d^2 Q_{ij}}{dt^2}
   \]

### **2. Potential Experimental Signatures**

#### **A. Observable Differences from GR**
1. **Directional Dependence**:
   - The spin alignment in sub-space might introduce anisotropies in wave propagation.
   - Gravitational waves could exhibit slight variations in amplitude or polarization based on their direction relative to the spin field.

2. **Coupling with Electromagnetic Waves**:
   - If spin alignments influence both gravitational and electromagnetic fields, there could be weak coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic waves.

3. **Wave Dispersion**:
   - In the UFT-NN model, the spin waves could exhibit frequency-dependent dispersion due to variations in sub-space density or structure.

4. **Higher-Order Effects**:
   - Gravitational waves might include higher-order multipole contributions (e.g., octupole or hexadecapole) from complex vortex interactions.

#### **B. Experimental Predictions**
1. **LIGO/Virgo Data Analysis**:
   - Look for anisotropic effects in wave propagation or polarization patterns that differ from standard GR predictions.
   - Examine correlations between detected gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals.

2. **Precision Tests in Strong-Field Regimes**:
   - Near black holes or neutron stars, the spin field's influence might be more pronounced, leading to measurable deviations in waveforms.

3. **Cosmological Gravitational Waves**:
   - Primordial gravitational waves could carry imprints of sub-space spin alignments from the early universe.
   - UFT-NN might predict deviations in the cosmic microwave background's B-mode polarization.

4. **Localized Sub-Space Spin Effects**:
   - Laboratory experiments with high-energy collisions or spinning systems could potentially create detectable perturbations in spin alignment.

### **Summary**

#### **Mathematical Formalism**:
- Gravitational waves arise from perturbations in the sub-space spin field.
- Their dynamics follow a wave equation with a source term based on vortex interactions.
- Energy and amplitude depend on the quadrupole moment of the spin alignment density.

#### **Experimental Signatures**:
- Look for anisotropies, dispersion, or coupling effects in gravitational wave data.
- Strong-field regions and primordial signals offer promising areas for testing.
- Laboratory experiments could provide insights into spin alignment perturbations.
