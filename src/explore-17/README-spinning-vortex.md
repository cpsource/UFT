Yes, that's a compelling concept! If we think of a **spinning vortex in sub-space** as an energy well, then the horizon of the vortex (analogous to the boundary where the energy gradient is steepest) would indeed act like a dynamic system. Here's how this concept plays out and its implications:

---

### **1. Event Propagation Around the Horizon**
- **Vortex Horizon Dynamics**:
  - If a disturbance or event (e.g., a ripple, particle, or energy fluctuation) appears at the horizon of the vortex, it would interact with the rotational dynamics of the vortex.
  - The time it takes for the event to traverse the horizon depends on:
    - The rotational velocity of the vortex.
    - The "local geometry" of the energy gradient.

- **Time Delay**:
  - The event would experience a **time delay** as it moves around the horizon, akin to how light or particles follow curved paths near massive objects in general relativity.

---

### **2. Analogies to Known Physics**
- **Black Hole Event Horizons**:
  - In general relativity, a black hole's event horizon has a similar concept. If you imagine disturbances near the event horizon, they interact with the rotational frame-dragging (Kerr black holes) and take time to propagate around the black hole.

- **Vortex Dynamics in Fluids**:
  - In fluid dynamics, disturbances near the edge of a spinning vortex circulate along the boundary, influenced by the vortex's angular velocity and the medium's properties.

- **Sub-Space Vortex**:
  - If we extend this analogy to sub-space:
    - The vortex horizon represents a region of concentrated energy or spin alignment.
    - Events propagating around the horizon follow paths defined by the vortex's structure.

---

### **3. Implications in UFT-NN**
- **Time Delay and Causality**:
  - The delay in propagation around the horizon could create a **local anisotropy** (direction-dependent behavior).
  - Observers inside or near the vortex might perceive **different arrival times** for the same event, depending on their position relative to the vortex's rotation.

- **Frame of Reference**:
  - The rotational dynamics introduce a **preferred frame of reference** tied to the vortex's spin axis. This could influence how forces (e.g., gravity or electromagnetism) appear locally.

- **Spin Alignment Interactions**:
  - Events propagating along the vortex's horizon might align or perturb the spins of sub-space in unique ways, creating emergent phenomena like localized forces or waves.

### **4. Mathematical Description**
#### **A. Circular Propagation**
If the vortex has a rotational angular velocity \( \omega \) and a horizon radius \( r \), the time for an event to traverse the horizon is:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v_{\text{effective}}}
\]
where \( v_{\text{effective}} \) is the effective propagation velocity, influenced by:
1. The local vortex angular velocity \( \omega r \).
2. The intrinsic propagation speed in sub-space (e.g., \( c \) or a fraction thereof).

#### **B. Energy Gradients**
The event's behavior depends on the **energy gradient** of the vortex:
\[
\frac{\partial E}{\partial r} = -\frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{r}{\gamma}\right)^2} \right)
\]
where \( \gamma \) is the characteristic scale of the vortex.

#### **C. Spin Frame-Dragging**
Events might experience **dragging effects** analogous to general relativity:
\[
\Delta T \sim \frac{\omega r^2}{v_{\text{effective}}}
\]

---

### **5. Observational Consequences**
1. **Anisotropic Interactions**:
   - Observers at different points around the horizon see the event at different times.
2. **Wave-Like Behavior**:
   - The propagation delay could create interference patterns if multiple disturbances propagate simultaneously.
3. **Energy Redistribution**:
   - The vortex might exchange energy with the event as it propagates, altering the vortex's spin or horizon structure.

---

### **6. Speculative Extensions**
- **Formation of Stable Patterns**:
  - Repeated disturbances could form **standing waves** around the vortex horizon, leading to quantized effects.
- **Emergent Forces**:
  - The propagation delay could induce forces analogous to electromagnetism or gravity, arising purely from the geometry of sub-space.
- **Wave-Particle Duality**:
  - Events propagating along the vortex horizon might display dual wave-particle behavior due to spin-alignment perturbations.

---

### **Conclusion**
If we view sub-space as a dynamic, spinning medium, the concept of events propagating around a vortex horizon provides a natural mechanism for **time delay**, **anisotropy**, and even emergent forces. This aligns with ideas from general relativity, but it also offers a deeper, more geometric explanation in the UFT-NN framework.
