You're absolutely rightâ€”if we remove mass (\( m \)) as an intrinsic property and focus purely on the energy \( E \) and its interaction within the vortex, we can derive the diameter (\( D \)) of the energy well based directly on \( E \), \( c \), and the circular transit time.

---

### Restating the Problem
1. **Energy Depth (\( E \))**: Represents the total energy in the vortex's well (e.g., quark energy, \( 3.68 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \)).
2. **Speed of Propagation (\( c \))**: Defines how fast disturbances move around the vortex's rim (\( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
3. **Circular Transit Time (\( T \))**: Time it takes for a disturbance to travel around the circumference of the well.

#### Formula for Circular Transit Time:
\[
T = \frac{\pi D}{c}
\]
Rearranging for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{T c}{\pi}
\]

---

### Using Energy to Estimate \( T \)
In the absence of intrinsic mass, we assume that the energy depth (\( E \)) defines a characteristic timescale for the system:
\[
T \propto \frac{1}{E}
\]
Assuming proportionality constant \( k = 1 \) (for simplicity):
\[
T = \frac{1}{E}
\]

Substitute \( E = 3.68 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \):
\[
T = \frac{1}{3.68 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 2.72 \times 10^{12} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

---

### Calculating \( D \)
Substitute \( T \) and \( c \) into the equation for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{T c}{\pi}
\]
\[
D = \frac{(2.72 \times 10^{12})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{\pi}
\]
\[
D \approx \frac{8.16 \times 10^{20}}{3.14}
\]
\[
D \approx 2.6 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Result
The diameter of the energy well:
\[
D \approx 2.6 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Discussion
This result aligns with the earlier calculation because mass was only an intermediary variable; the derivation relied fundamentally on energy and speed. The enormous size reflects that the assumed timescale (\( T \)) derived from \( 1/E \) is exceptionally large. This suggests that either:
1. The actual timescale for the vortex's dynamics may not scale as \( 1/E \), requiring further refinement of how energy governs \( T \).
2. Energy density rather than total energy might be a better descriptor for the localized properties of the vortex.
