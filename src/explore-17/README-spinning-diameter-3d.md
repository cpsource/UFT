Spinning the vortex in **3D** instead of **2D** introduces a richer structure to the energy well and allows us to consider additional degrees of freedom, such as the radial, azimuthal, and polar components of motion. This 3D perspective can help refine the math by accounting for how energy is distributed and propagated in a spatially extended vortex. Letâ€™s work through this.

---

### **1. Key Adjustments in 3D**
1. **Vortex Structure in 3D**:
   - A 2D vortex has a circular boundary, while a 3D vortex is better represented as a **spherical shell** or a **toroid**.
   - Events propagate along the **spherical horizon** (e.g., a spinning energy well or field) with radius \( r \).

2. **Energy Distribution**:
   - In 2D, the energy \( E \) was confined to the rim (a 1D boundary).
   - In 3D, energy \( E \) spreads over the spherical surface, so the **energy density** is defined over a spherical area:
     \[
     \rho = \frac{E}{4\pi r^2}
     \]

3. **Transit Time in 3D**:
   - Instead of moving along a 2D circumference, events in 3D traverse paths along the spherical surface.
   - The characteristic distance traveled is the **great circle arc length**, which is:
     \[
     d = 2\pi r
     \]
   - Transit time \( T \) is still:
     \[
     T = \frac{d}{c} = \frac{2\pi r}{c}
     \]

---

### **2. Relating Energy to the Radius**
Using the energy density formula:
\[
E = \rho \cdot 4\pi r^2
\]
Rearranging for \( r \):
\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{E}{4\pi \rho}}
\]

Substitute \( \rho \) with vacuum energy density:
\[
\rho_{vac} \sim 10^{-9} \, \text{J/m}^3
\]
and \( E = 3.68 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \):
\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{3.68 \times 10^{-13}}{4\pi \cdot 10^{-9}}}
\]
\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{3.68 \times 10^{-13}}{1.26 \times 10^{-8}}} \approx \sqrt{2.92 \times 10^{-5}}
\]
\[
r \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \, (\text{or } 5.41 \, \text{mm})
\]

This result gives a more **realistic scale** for the radius of the energy well when considering 3D distribution.

### **3. Number of Vortex Crossings**
If propagation involves crossing \( N \) vortexes to achieve the effective speed \( c \), we use:
\[
N = \frac{c \cdot T}{d}
\]
Substituting \( T = \frac{2\pi r}{c} \) and \( d = 2\pi r \):
\[
N = \frac{c \cdot \frac{2\pi r}{c}}{2\pi r}
\]
\[
N = 1
\]
This result suggests that in a single vortex framework, the event travels entirely along the horizon of one vortex. However, if \( N > 1 \) is required, it implies nested or overlapping vortexes in 3D.

---

### **4. Implications of a 3D Vortex**
1. **Improved Scalability**:
   - A 3D model distributes energy more realistically, resulting in a smaller and more reasonable radius for the energy well.

2. **Energy Localization**:
   - The energy density \( \rho \) is now inversely proportional to \( r^2 \), reflecting the spread over the spherical surface.

3. **Nested or Layered Vortexes**:
   - In 3D, nested vortex structures could account for \( N > 1 \) crossings, introducing complex interactions between adjacent energy wells.

4. **Realistic Transit Times**:
   - The transit time \( T = \frac{2\pi r}{c} \) becomes feasible for small radii, avoiding the astronomical timescales seen in 2D.

---

### **5. Refined Result**
- **Radius of the Energy Well**: \( r \approx 5.41 \, \text{mm} \).
- **Transit Time**: \( T \approx \frac{2\pi \cdot 5.41 \times 10^{-3}}{3.0 \times 10^8} \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{s} \).
- **Single Vortex Crossing** (\( N = 1 \)) provides effective propagation.

---

### **Conclusion**
By modeling the vortex in 3D, we achieve:
1. A **realistic radius** (\( \sim 5.41 \, \text{mm} \)).
2. Feasible transit times for events propagating at \( c \).
3. A framework for more complex interactions via nested or layered vortexes.
