To calculate the diameter of the energy well based on the energy of a quark and the assumption that the speed of propagation along the rim equals \( c \), let's follow these steps:

---

### **Given Data**
1. **Quark Energy**: 
   - We'll use the energy of an up quark, which is approximately \( 2.3 \, \text{MeV} = 2.3 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \).
   - Convert to joules: \( E = 2.3 \times 10^6 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 3.68 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \).

2. **Transit Speed**:
   - Propagation speed along the rim is \( c \approx 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Assumptions**:
   - The depth of the energy well is equal to the quark's energy.
   - Transit time around the rim is defined by \( T = \frac{\text{circumference}}{c} = \frac{\pi D}{c} \), where \( D \) is the diameter.

### **Step 1: Expressing Energy**
The energy \( E \) is related to the dynamics of the well:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]
Here, the effective "mass" \( m \) and velocity \( v = c \) govern the system. Rearrange to find \( m \):
\[
m = \frac{2E}{v^2} = \frac{2E}{c^2}
\]

Using \( E = 3.68 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \) and \( c^2 = (3.0 \times 10^8)^2 = 9.0 \times 10^{16} \):
\[
m = \frac{2 \times 3.68 \times 10^{-13}}{9.0 \times 10^{16}} = 8.18 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg}
\]

---

### **Step 2: Relating Energy to Well Diameter**
Assuming the energy well depth \( E \) defines the potential energy across its diameter, we can calculate the diameter \( D \). Using the transit time:
\[
T = \frac{\pi D}{c}
\]
We solve for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{T c}{\pi}
\]

Assume \( T \) is directly related to the energy distribution in the well. For simplicity, let \( T \) be proportional to the characteristic timescale of energy \( \tau \sim E^{-1} \). Using a rough scaling:
\[
T = k \tau = \frac{k}{E}
\]

For simplicity, assume \( k = 1 \) (a normalized constant):
\[
T = \frac{1}{E} = \frac{1}{3.68 \times 10^{-13}}
\]
\[
T \approx 2.72 \times 10^{12} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

Now calculate \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{T c}{\pi} = \frac{2.72 \times 10^{12} \cdot 3.0 \times 10^8}{\pi}
\]
\[
D \approx 2.6 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}
\]

---

### **Results**
1. **Energy Depth**: \( 3.68 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \).
2. **Transit Speed**: \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
3. **Diameter of Energy Well**: \( D \approx 2.6 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m} \).

---

### **Discussion**
The resulting diameter suggests an astronomically large scale, which may indicate:
1. The assumptions about time scales and energy density distributions need refinement.
2. We might need to use more localized energy definitions or normalization factors for the well.

Would you like to refine these calculations further or explore additional factors influencing the well size? ðŸš€
