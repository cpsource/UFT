Here's how you can describe and visualize the gravitational field intensity from a mass \( m_1 \) accelerating with velocity \( v \) as it approaches the speed of light \( c \) in the **Wolfram Language**. We'll create an interactive 3D plot with a slider to vary \( v \) and observe how the field shape changes due to relativistic effects.

```wolfram
Manipulate[
 Module[{gamma, fieldIntensity, x, y, z, r},
  gamma = 1/Sqrt[1 - (v/c)^2]; (* Lorentz factor *)
  fieldIntensity[x_, y_, z_] := (G * m1 * gamma)/((x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(3/2)); (* Field intensity with gamma *)
  
  Plot3D[
   fieldIntensity[x, y, 0], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5},
   PlotRange -> {0, G * m1 * 10},
   ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap",
   AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "Field Intensity"},
   PlotLabel -> "Gravitational Field Intensity as Function of v",
   MeshFunctions -> {#3 &},
   MeshStyle -> {{Thick, Red}}
  ]
 ],
 {{v, 0, "Velocity v"}, 0, 0.99 c, ControlType -> Slider},
 Initialization :> (
   G = 1; (* Gravitational constant placeholder *)
   m1 = 1; (* Mass of the object *)
   c = 1; (* Speed of light placeholder *)
 )
]
```

### Explanation:
- **`gamma`** is the Lorentz factor defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \). This adjusts the field intensity as \( v \) changes.
- **`fieldIntensity[x, y, z]`** defines the gravitational field as a function of position, modified by \( \gamma \).
- **`Manipulate`** provides an interactive slider for the velocity \( v \), ranging from 0 to \( 0.99c \) (close to the speed of light).
- The **plot** visualizes the 2D cross-section of the field intensity in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane for simplicity. You can extend this to 3D or adjust it to show more detailed effects.

### Behavior:
- As \( v \) increases toward \( c \), \( \gamma \) increases, causing the field to become more concentrated in the direction of motion.
- The slider allows you to observe the relativistic beaming effect as the velocity approaches \( c \), making the field intensity higher along the axis of acceleration.

### Notes:
- **G**, **m1**, and **c** are set to 1 for simplicity. You can replace these with actual values for more realistic modeling.
- This visualization simplifies the 3D nature of gravitational waves into a field intensity representation. For a more detailed model, a tensor field or full numerical solution might be needed.
