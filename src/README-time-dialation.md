The formula for **time dilation** as you approach the speed of light \( c \) is derived from **special relativity**. When an object moves at a high velocity relative to an observer, time appears to pass more slowly for the moving object than for the observer. This effect is known as **time dilation**.

### Time Dilation Formula

If an object is moving at a constant speed \( v \) relative to an observer, the time dilation formula is:

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

where:
- \( \Delta t \): The **proper time interval** (time interval measured by an observer at rest with respect to the moving object).
- \( \Delta t' \): The **dilated time interval** (time interval measured by an observer for whom the object is moving at speed \( v \)).
- \( v \): The **speed** of the moving object relative to the observer.
- \( c \): The **speed of light** in a vacuum (\( \approx 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s).

### Explanation of the Formula

- **Time Dilation**: As \( v \) approaches \( c \), the denominator \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \) approaches zero, causing \( \Delta t' \) to become very large. This means that time appears to pass infinitely slowly for an object moving at the speed of light relative to the observer.
- **At Rest**: If \( v = 0 \), then \( \Delta t' = \Delta t \), meaning there is no time dilation when the object is at rest relative to the observer.
- **Approaching \( c \)**: As \( v \) gets closer to \( c \), the time dilation effect becomes more pronounced, with \( \Delta t' \) increasing dramatically.

### Thought Experiment as \( v \to c \)

If an object could theoretically reach the speed of light \( c \):
- The term \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \) would become zero, making the denominator zero and \( \Delta t' \) approach infinity.
- This implies that time **would stop** entirely for the object from the perspective of an external observer.

### Example Calculation

Suppose an object moves at 90% of the speed of light (\( v = 0.9c \)):
\[
\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.9c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - 0.81}} = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{0.19}} \approx \frac{\Delta t}{0.436}
\]
This results in \( \Delta t' \approx 2.29 \Delta t \), meaning time appears to pass about 2.29 times slower for the moving object compared to the stationary observer.

### Summary

The time dilation formula shows that, as an object approaches the speed of light \( c \), the passage of time for that object (relative to an outside observer) slows down dramatically, approaching zero. This effect is a fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of special relativity and has been experimentally confirmed through observations such as the decay rates of fast-moving particles and the synchronization of atomic clocks on fast-moving planes or satellites.
