The scenario you’re describing involves rotating a mass at the end of a pole to generate periodic changes in the gravitational field. This is, in essence, the creation of **gravitational waves** or **oscillations in the gravitational field** at a frequency that matches the rotation of the mass. Here’s a detailed breakdown of whether such an experiment would detect changes in gravity and what kind of detector you would need:

### 1. **Concept of Rotating Mass and Gravitational Waves**
- **Mass and Rotation**: Rotating a mass (such as a lead weight) will indeed create oscillations in the gravitational field due to the changing distribution of mass over time. These oscillations will propagate outward as **gravitational waves**.
- **Intensity and Scale**: However, the gravitational waves produced by such a system would be extremely weak. Gravitational wave intensity depends on the mass involved, the acceleration, and the distance from the source. A rotating lead weight would produce a minuscule gravitational wave because the energy emitted in gravitational radiation scales with the **quadrupole moment** of the mass distribution and is proportional to \( \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the source.

### 2. **Change in Gravity and Expected Strength**
- **Variation in Local Gravity**: The detector placed near the rotating mass might detect minute changes in gravity as the mass moves. These changes would not be static but would oscillate with the rotation frequency of the pole.
- **Amplitude of Changes**: The gravitational effect from a rotating lead weight would be extremely small. The power radiated as gravitational waves is described by:
  \[
  P \propto \frac{G}{c^5} \left( \ddot{Q} \right)^2
  \]
  where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \ddot{Q} \) is the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the system.
- **Detectable Changes**: For typical lab-scale experiments with a rotating mass, the gravitational wave strain (\( h \)) would be many orders of magnitude smaller than what can be detected with current technology. The strain is often estimated by:
  \[
  h \propto \frac{2G}{c^4} \frac{I \omega^2}{r}
  \]
  where \( I \) is the moment of inertia, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the rotation, and \( r \) is the distance to the detector. For small systems, \( h \) is extremely small (e.g., \( 10^{-20} \) or smaller).

### 3. **Types of Detectors Needed**
- **Laser Interferometers**: Modern gravitational wave detectors, like **LIGO** and **Virgo**, use laser interferometry to detect changes in distance between suspended mirrors caused by passing gravitational waves. These detectors are extremely sensitive, capable of detecting strains as small as \( 10^{-21} \) over several kilometers.
- **Challenges for Lab-Scale Detection**:
  - The gravitational waves produced by a rotating lead weight would be far too weak for current interferometers to detect.
  - Smaller interferometric devices could be constructed, but they would need to be orders of magnitude more sensitive than current technology allows.

- **Gravimeters**: Gravimeters, which measure local variations in gravity, are typically used for detecting static or slowly changing gravitational fields (e.g., from geological formations). They are not designed to detect high-frequency oscillations like those from a rotating mass.

### 4. **Realistic Detection Considerations**
- **Signal Strength**: The gravitational wave signal from a rotating mass would be extremely weak compared to those produced by astrophysical events like merging black holes or neutron stars. The difference in energy output is vast, making lab-scale experiments challenging.
- **Detector Sensitivity**: To detect such a small signal, a new type of detector with sensitivity far beyond current technology would be needed. This might involve quantum-level interferometers or other novel techniques.

### 5. **Possible Experimental Enhancements**
- **Increasing Mass and Frequency**: Using a larger mass or rotating at a higher frequency could increase the gravitational wave amplitude, but practical limits on rotational speed and the strength of materials would pose significant challenges.
- **Using Superconductors or Dense Materials**: Superdense materials or superconductors might be explored to amplify the effects, although this remains speculative and has not been experimentally verified.

### 6. **Comparison to Existing Gravitational Wave Detectors**
- **Astrophysical Sources**: Current gravitational wave detectors were designed to detect events involving astronomical masses (e.g., black holes with masses greater than a few solar masses), which produce much stronger signals.
- **Sensitivity**: LIGO, for instance, can detect changes as small as one-thousandth the diameter of a proton over a 4-km arm. However, even this level of sensitivity would not be sufficient for detecting the minute gravitational waves produced by a rotating mass in a laboratory.

### **Conclusion**
While it is theoretically true that rotating a mass at the end of a pole would create small oscillations in the gravitational field, the magnitude of these changes would be exceedingly small. Detecting such minute variations would require a detector with unprecedented sensitivity, far beyond what current technology can achieve. Laser interferometers like **LIGO** and **Virgo** are capable of detecting gravitational waves from massive astrophysical events but would not be able to detect the weak gravitational waves from a rotating lab-scale mass.

**Future possibilities** for detecting such small gravitational effects might include advances in **quantum sensing**, **ultra-sensitive interferometry**, or novel theoretical breakthroughs in detecting gravitational interactions at small scales.
