Yes, **inertial navigation systems (INS)** used in aircraft and other vehicles do serve as detectors, but they function differently than what is needed to detect **gravitational waves** or **oscillations in gravitational fields** like those in your experiment. Let's break down what inertial navigation systems do, how they relate to detecting gravitational effects, and what they can and cannot detect.

### 1. **What Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) Do**
- **Basic Function**: INS are self-contained systems that measure the position, orientation, and velocity of an object relative to a starting point. They use **accelerometers** to measure linear acceleration and **gyroscopes** to measure rotation.
- **Components**:
  - **Accelerometers**: Measure acceleration forces, which can be integrated to determine velocity and position.
  - **Gyroscopes**: Measure changes in orientation or angular velocity.
- **Applications**: Commonly used in aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, and guided missiles for navigation without external references like GPS.

### 2. **Can INS Detect Changes in Gravity?**
- **Local Gravity Variations**: INS can sense changes in acceleration due to **local gravitational anomalies**, such as those caused by variations in Earth’s density (e.g., flying over a mountain or an underground mass). These changes are very small and are generally accounted for in precise navigation algorithms.
- **What They Don’t Detect**:
  - **Gravitational Waves**: The sensitivity of INS is not nearly enough to detect tiny oscillations in the gravitational field, such as those produced by your proposed rotating mass experiment. Detecting gravitational waves requires devices like **laser interferometers** with sensitivities capable of measuring spacetime distortions at scales as small as \(10^{-21}\).
  - **Oscillatory Gravitational Fields**: While INS can measure acceleration changes, they are not designed to detect oscillating gravitational fields at high frequencies or with extremely low amplitudes.

### 3. **How INS Detects Gravitational Effects**
- **Indirect Detection**: INS can pick up subtle changes in acceleration due to variations in gravity, such as flying over different terrain or when subjected to Earth’s gravitational field. This data can be used for **gravity gradiometry**, which measures the gradient of the gravitational field to detect subsurface density variations.
- **Accuracy Limits**: The accelerometers in an INS have limited sensitivity and are designed for navigation, not for detecting ultra-fine gravitational effects or gravitational waves.

### 4. **Gravity Gradiometers**
- **Advanced Inertial Systems**: Some advanced inertial systems known as **gravity gradiometers** are capable of measuring the gradient of the gravitational field. These devices are used in geophysical surveys and oil exploration to detect density variations underground.
- **How They Work**:
  - Measure the difference in gravitational acceleration between two or more accelerometers spaced apart, providing a more precise measurement of local gravitational field changes.
  - Can detect gravitational anomalies with greater sensitivity than typical INS.
- **Limitations**:
  - Even the most sensitive gravity gradiometers are not capable of detecting the kinds of oscillations you described from a rotating mass at the end of a pole. The amplitude of these oscillations would be many orders of magnitude too small for such instruments to pick up.

### 5. **Comparison with Gravitational Wave Detectors**
- **Gravitational Wave Detectors**: Devices like **LIGO** and **Virgo** use **laser interferometry** to detect minuscule changes in spacetime caused by gravitational waves. They can measure changes as small as a fraction of a proton's diameter over a 4-km distance.
- **INS Sensitivity**: An INS measures accelerations that are many orders of magnitude larger than what is needed to detect gravitational waves or minor oscillations in gravitational fields. The scale of gravitational wave detection is vastly smaller than what any INS can detect.

### 6. **Potential for Novel Gravitational Detectors**
- **New Technologies**: The development of quantum sensors, such as **quantum gravimeters** and **atomic interferometers**, has the potential to push the boundaries of gravity detection. These devices use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure gravitational forces with unprecedented precision.
- **Hypothetical Applications**: If quantum technologies continue to advance, they might one day be sensitive enough to detect smaller oscillations in gravity or subtle gravitational effects from lab-scale experiments.

### 7. **Could an INS Be Adapted for Your Experiment?**
- **Adapting an INS**: Modifying an INS to detect oscillatory gravitational effects would require significant advancements in sensitivity. The accelerometers would need to be replaced or supplemented with detectors capable of measuring extremely small gravitational changes.
- **Alternative Approach**: You would likely need to build a custom **gravitational sensor** or use an **atomic interferometer** designed for ultra-sensitive gravitational measurements, rather than relying on existing INS technology.

### Summary
- **Inertial navigation systems** are excellent for detecting **acceleration** and **local gravitational anomalies**, but they do not have the sensitivity to detect **gravitational waves** or **tiny oscillations** in the gravitational field such as those from a rotating mass experiment.
- **Advanced gravity gradiometers** can measure small variations in the gravitational field but still fall short of the sensitivity required for detecting gravitational waves or extremely subtle oscillatory effects.
- **State-of-the-art gravitational wave detectors** like **LIGO** use laser interferometry with extreme sensitivity to detect spacetime distortions far beyond the capability of any INS.
- **Future technologies**, such as **quantum sensors** and **atomic interferometers**, may hold the key to detecting more subtle gravitational effects, but these are still under development.

To detect the kind of gravitational effects you're describing in your experiment, you would need a highly sensitive, specialized gravitational detector, not an INS or conventional accelerometer.
