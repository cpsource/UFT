No, **particles do not have to be massless to be entangled**. Entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that applies to **all types of particles**, regardless of whether they have mass or not. Here's why:

---

### **Mass and Entanglement**
1. **Entanglement Is Independent of Mass**:
   - Entanglement arises when two or more particles share a quantum state, and their properties become correlated. The mass of the particles is irrelevant to this process.
   - Particles with mass (e.g., electrons, protons) and massless particles (e.g., photons) can both become entangled.

2. **Examples of Entangled Particles**:
   - **Massive Particles**:
     - Electrons: Entanglement of spin states is well-documented in electron pairs.
     - Atoms: Entire atoms or molecules can be entangled in experiments (e.g., Bose-Einstein condensates).
   - **Massless Particles**:
     - Photons: Entangled photons are commonly used in quantum optics and quantum cryptography.

3. **Mechanism of Entanglement**:
   - Entanglement depends on the **quantum state** of the particles (e.g., spin, momentum, polarization) rather than their mass.
   - The interaction that creates entanglement (e.g., particle decay, collisions) works equally well for massive and massless particles.

---

### **Key Properties That Can Be Entangled**
Mass is not a direct factor in entanglement. Instead, properties like the following can become entangled:
- **Spin**: For particles like electrons or protons.
- **Polarization**: For photons.
- **Momentum**: For any particle, including massive particles.
- **Position**: Quantum particles can exhibit entangled positions.

### **Entanglement and Relativity**
1. **Massless Particles (e.g., Photons)**:
   - Travel at the speed of light (\(c\)).
   - Their quantum states (e.g., polarization) are often used for entanglement because they are easy to produce and manipulate.

2. **Massive Particles (e.g., Electrons)**:
   - Move slower than \(c\).
   - Their entangled states (e.g., spin) are studied in contexts like condensed matter physics and quantum computing.

3. **No Preference for Massless Particles**:
   - While photons are popular in entanglement experiments, this is due to practical reasons (ease of creation, transmission, and detection), not because massless particles are uniquely suited for entanglement.

---

### **Experimental Evidence**
- **Bell's Tests**:
  - Entanglement experiments involving electrons (massive) and photons (massless) have consistently violated Bell inequalities, confirming entanglement.
- **Quantum Computing**:
  - Entangled qubits are often made from massive particles like trapped ions or superconducting circuits.
- **Large-Scale Entanglement**:
  - Experiments have even entangled large molecules (composed of many massive particles).

---

### **Conclusion**
Mass is not a requirement for entanglement. Both massive and massless particles can and do become entangled. What matters is the **quantum interaction** that creates the shared quantum state, not the intrinsic mass of the particles involved.
