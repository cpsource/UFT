No, if you subject one particle of an entangled pair to electromagnetic (EM) forces, the other particle will not directly respond to the applied force. Here's why:

### **Entanglement vs. Direct Interaction**
1. **Entanglement**:
   - Entangled particles share a correlated quantum state, meaning measurements of certain properties (like spin or polarization) will exhibit predictable relationships.
   - These correlations do not imply that applying a force to one particle will physically affect the other. Entanglement governs measurement outcomes, not direct interactions.

2. **Direct Interaction**:
   - Physical forces, like EM forces, act locally. When you apply an EM force to one particle, it affects that particle's motion or state, but this force does not "travel" to the other particle through the entanglement.

### **What Happens to the Entangled State?**
1. **Entanglement Can Be Disrupted**:
   - If the force you apply changes the quantum state of the first particle (e.g., through decoherence or measurement), it can destroy or alter the entangled state.
   - In this case, the particles may lose their entangled correlation entirely.

2. **No Instantaneous Effect**:
   - The second particle's state remains unchanged by the force applied to the first particle unless you perform a **measurement** on the first particle. In that case, the entangled state collapses, and the second particle's state becomes determined.

### **Non-local Correlations vs. Causal Effects**
- **Correlations**:
  - If you measure a property of one particle (e.g., spin along a specific axis), the outcome will correlate with the measurement on the other particle.
  - This correlation exists regardless of whether you subject one particle to EM forces or not.

- **No Causal Signal**:
  - Entanglement does not allow for faster-than-light communication or causal influence. Applying a force to one particle cannot transmit information or cause a physical response in the other particle.

### **Experimental Example**
Suppose you have two entangled electrons:
1. Electron A is placed in a magnetic field, which affects its spin.
2. Electron B, far away and isolated from the field, will not feel the magnetic field or change its state.

If you measure the spin of Electron A, it will collapse the entangled state, and the spin of Electron B will correlate with that measurement. However, this is a result of the shared entangled state, not the magnetic field itself.

---

### **Conclusion**
Applying EM forces to one entangled particle affects only that particle directly. The other particle does not physically respond to the force. However, if you perform a measurement on the particle subjected to EM forces, it may collapse the entangled state and determine the correlated property of the other particle. This highlights the non-local yet non-causal nature of entanglement.
