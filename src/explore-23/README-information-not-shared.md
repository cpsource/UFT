This is a fundamental and subtle question in quantum mechanics. To understand why **no usable information** is transmitted between entangled particles when one collapses, we must carefully examine the nature of quantum entanglement and measurement:

---

### **1. What Happens When One Particle is Measured?**
- In an entangled pair, the quantum state of the two particles is described by a shared wave function. For example, in a simple entangled spin state:
  \[
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow_A\rangle |\downarrow_B\rangle + |\downarrow_A\rangle |\uparrow_B\rangle),
  \]
  where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are spin-up and spin-down states.

- When you measure particle A, say, and find it in the \( |\uparrow\rangle \) state, the entangled wave function collapses, and particle B's state is immediately determined to be \( |\downarrow\rangle \).

---

### **2. Why This Doesn't Transmit Information**
- **Randomness of Measurement Outcomes**:
  - The result of measuring particle A is fundamentally random.
  - Before the measurement, there is no way to predict whether particle A will collapse to \( |\uparrow\rangle \) or \( |\downarrow\rangle \). Consequently, the state of particle B is also unpredictable until the measurement is made.
  - This randomness prevents you from encoding any deliberate message or information in the state of particle A.

- **No Control Over Collapse**:
  - You cannot control how particle A collapses. Whether you observe \( |\uparrow\rangle \) or \( |\downarrow\rangle \) is probabilistic, governed by the quantum wave function.
  - Since you can't influence the outcome, there's no way to "send" a specific message to particle B.

- **Local Observations Are Incomplete**:
  - When particle B's state is measured, the result will match the correlation implied by the entangled state. However, without access to the results of particle A's measurement, the observer at particle B cannot determine whether their particle's state is correlated with another particle or is simply in a random state.

---

### **3. Bell's Theorem and Non-locality**
- Entanglement correlations are non-local, meaning they appear to "instantaneously" influence distant particles. However, these correlations cannot be used to transmit information faster than the speed of light, preserving causality.

---

### **4. Example: Alice and Bob**
- Suppose Alice has particle A, and Bob has particle B. They are far apart, and their particles are entangled.
- If Alice measures particle A, its state collapses. Bob's particle B is now determined as well.
- However:
  - Alice's result is random.
  - Bob's result is random until he measures it.
  - When Alice and Bob compare their results later, they will find the expected correlations (e.g., opposite spins). But until then, Bob's measurement provides no indication that Alice has measured her particle.

---

### **5. Why Information Isn't Shared**
For information to be transmitted, Alice would need to:
1. Choose a specific state for her particle (e.g., force particle A into \( |\uparrow\rangle \)).
2. Ensure that this choice influences Bob's particle in a predictable way.

However, quantum mechanics forbids Alice from controlling the outcome of her measurement, as the collapse is inherently probabilistic. This lack of control ensures that **no information is shared instantaneously through the entanglement process**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The collapse of one particle's state in an entangled pair correlates the states of both particles, but it does not transmit any usable information. The randomness of quantum measurement and the lack of control over the collapse prevent entanglement from violating causality or enabling faster-than-light communication. This is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and has been confirmed experimentally.
