**Coulomb's Law** describes the electrostatic force between two charged objects. It states that:

1. The force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges.
2. The force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
3. The force acts along the line connecting the two charges and can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the signs of the charges.

### **Mathematical Formulation**
\[
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \( F \): Electrostatic force between the two charges (in newtons, N).
- \( k \): Coulomb's constant, approximately \( 8.987 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) (in vacuum).
- \( q_1, q_2 \): Magnitudes of the two charges (in coulombs, C).
- \( r \): Distance between the centers of the two charges (in meters, m).

### **Key Points**
- \( F > 0 \): Repulsive force (charges have the same sign).
- \( F < 0 \): Attractive force (charges have opposite signs).
- \( k \) incorporates the permittivity of free space:
  \[
  k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
  \]
  Where \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N·m}^2 \) is the vacuum permittivity.

### **Vector Form**
The force can also be expressed as a vector:
\[
\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]
Where \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from one charge to the other.

### **Applications**
- Explains the behavior of charged particles in electric fields.
- Fundamental to understanding electric circuits, electrostatics, and electromagnetic theory.
