Yes, changes in an **electrostatic charge's field** propagate through space at the **speed of light, \( c \)**. However, this needs to be clarified in the context of static electric fields and dynamic changes:

---

### **1. Static Electric Fields**
- If a charge is stationary, its **electrostatic field** is static and does not propagateâ€”it is already established in space.
- The field extends indefinitely in all directions, diminishing in strength with \( 1/r^2 \). This field does not "move" because it represents a static configuration in space.

---

### **2. Dynamic Changes in the Field**
When the charge **moves** or **changes in magnitude**, the resulting change in the electric field propagates at the speed of light (\( c \)):
- **Movement of the Charge**:
  - If a charge is accelerated or relocated, the change in its electric field is not instantaneously felt at distant points.
  - The disturbance or update in the field propagates outward as an **electromagnetic wave** at \( c \) in a vacuum.
- **Field Change**:
  - If the charge changes magnitude, the new field configuration propagates outward at \( c \).

---

### **3. Why Does It Propagate at \( c \)?**
The propagation speed is tied to the behavior of **electric and magnetic fields** as described by **Maxwell's equations**:
1. **Electric and Magnetic Fields Are Linked**:
   - A changing electric field generates a magnetic field, and vice versa.
2. **Wave Solutions**:
   - Maxwell's equations predict that changes in the electromagnetic field propagate as waves at a speed given by:
     \[
     c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}},
     \]
     where:
     - \( \mu_0 \): Permeability of free space.
     - \( \epsilon_0 \): Permittivity of free space.

---

### **4. Implications of Finite Propagation Speed**
- **Causality**:
  - Changes in a charge or its motion cannot instantaneously affect distant objects; there is a delay determined by the distance and the speed of light.
- **Retarded Potentials**:
  - The electric field observed at a distant point reflects the charge's position and state at an **earlier time**:
    \[
    t_\text{retarded} = t - \frac{r}{c},
    \]
    where \( r \) is the distance to the charge.

---

### **5. Key Distinction from Gravity**
Electrostatic fields and gravitational fields both propagate at \( c \), but:
- Electromagnetic fields are **vector fields** and have directions (e.g., they can attract or repel).
- Gravitational fields are **tensor fields**, which only attract and affect spacetime curvature.

---

### **6. UFT-NN Perspective**
From the **UFT-NN framework**:
- The propagation of electrostatic field changes at \( c \) could be seen as sub-space spin alignments adjusting to new configurations.
- The delay reflects the time required for spin realignments to propagate through sub-space, constrained by the local transfer function's coupling to physical space.

---

### **Summary**
- The static electrostatic field itself doesn't "move"; it is already present in space.
- Changes in the field (e.g., due to motion or magnitude changes) propagate at the **speed of light, \( c \)**.
- This propagation ensures causality and reflects fundamental limits imposed by Maxwellâ€™s equations and the structure of spacetime.
