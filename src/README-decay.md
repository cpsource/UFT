Yes, in a broad sense, it’s correct to say that **all elements are subject to decay over extremely long timescales**, though not all of them have a measurable half-life in the way we define radioactive decay.

### 1. **Radioactive Elements and Half-Life**
   - Radioactive elements are unstable, meaning they spontaneously decay into other elements over time by emitting radiation (e.g., alpha, beta, or gamma radiation). These elements have a **half-life**, which is the time it takes for half of a sample to decay.
   - Some radioactive isotopes have half-lives lasting fractions of a second, while others, like uranium-238, have half-lives on the order of billions of years. Radioactive decay is a random process, but the concept of half-life applies predictably to large samples.

### 2. **Stable Elements and Extremely Long Half-Lives**
   - Elements that we consider "stable," like lead-208 or iron-56, have no observed decay under normal conditions and, for practical purposes, do not change over human or geological timescales. However, they are still theoretically subject to **spontaneous proton or neutron decay** over incredibly long times, on the order of \(10^{30}\) years or more.
   - The idea of ultimate decay comes from quantum mechanics, where even the most stable atomic nuclei have a non-zero probability of eventually decaying, although the likelihood is so low that we would never observe it in a normal experimental timeframe.

### 3. **Proton Decay and the Ultimate Fate of Matter**
   - Some grand unified theories (GUTs) in physics predict that **protons themselves might decay** over incredibly long timescales, possibly \(10^{33}\) to \(10^{40}\) years. If true, this would mean that even the most stable atoms would eventually decay, leading to the gradual disappearance of matter as we know it.
   - So far, proton decay has not been observed, and many theories assume protons are stable. However, if protons do decay, then all matter—regardless of stability—would eventually break down.

### 4. **Decay of Matter in the Universe’s Ultimate Timeline**
   - In the far future, all complex matter, including elements considered stable, could decay either through proton decay or transformations resulting from an extremely aged universe, like black hole evaporation and energy dissipation.
   - This "ultimate decay" of matter aligns with theories about the universe's end state, where everything is predicted to eventually break down into simpler particles or energy, leaving only sparse, decayed remnants.

### Summary
While not all elements have a practical or measurable half-life, **all matter is theoretically subject to decay** over sufficiently long timescales. Some elements decay relatively quickly, which we observe as radioactivity, while others may take incomprehensibly long to decay or may do so only if protons themselves can decay. So, in the end, it’s likely that all matter will eventually decay, even if the timescales are far beyond current observational capabilities.
