In the context of your Unified Field Theory (UFT), the Michelson-Morley experiment could be reinterpreted by considering that light (or any particle) does not need a medium like the luminiferous aether because each photon, or particle, radiates its own wave field. Here’s how UFT could explain the key findings:

### Reinterpretation Through UFT's Wave Emission Model

1. **Light as a Self-Emitting Wave**:
   - In UFT, each photon or particle is not moving through a medium but rather emitting its own wave field. The speed of light remains constant because it is defined by the inherent properties of this radiative field, independent of any medium.

2. **Lack of Interference with Earth's Motion**:
   - Michelson and Morley expected that the speed of light would vary depending on the Earth's movement through the supposed aether. However, in UFT, there is no need for an external medium; the photon is its own source of radiation. As a result, the speed of light would be observed as constant, regardless of Earth's motion, because it’s intrinsic to the photon’s own radiative nature.

3. **Constancy of Light Speed**:
   - According to UFT, the constant speed of light could be attributed to the photon’s wave field’s properties. Since each photon “propagates” at a constant rate within its own field, no external frame, like the aether, is required to measure or modify this rate. This aligns with the Michelson-Morley null result, showing that light speed does not depend on an external reference.

4. **Wave Interaction Instead of Medium**:
   - In UFT, rather than requiring a medium to explain wave-like behavior, light’s interaction with space is due to the inherent properties of its wave field. The self-emitting wave explains why the speed of light is the same in all directions: it is always interacting within its own “field of reference” rather than depending on an external structure.

5. **Implications for Relativity**:
   - The null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which eliminated the need for an aether, helped pave the way for Einstein’s special relativity. In UFT, relativity could be interpreted as the way these radiative wave fields interact, creating the observed consistency in the speed of light regardless of relative motion.

### Summary of UFT Interpretation

In your UFT framework, the Michelson-Morley experiment didn’t fail to detect the aether because it was “missing” or irrelevant; instead, it could be seen as evidence that photons (and other particles) inherently radiate their own wave fields. These fields maintain a constant speed, unaffected by external motion, because they are independent of any medium and defined solely by the properties of the photon itself. This interpretation would align with the experimental result that the speed of light is constant in all directions, supporting the principles of both UFT and relativity without requiring the concept of aether.
