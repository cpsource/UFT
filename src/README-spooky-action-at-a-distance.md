"Spooky action at a distance," or quantum entanglement, appears to occur instantaneously, not limited by the speed of light (\( c \)). Experiments show that when two particles are entangled, a change in the state of one particle is reflected in the other immediately, even if they are separated by large distances.

### Key Insights

1. **Instantaneous Correlation**:
   - Experiments, particularly those testing Bell’s theorem, have shown that changes in the state of one entangled particle seem to correlate with the other’s state without any time lag. This correlation has been tested over distances where light would take measurable time to travel, yet the entanglement effects still appear to be immediate.

2. **No Signal Transmission**:
   - Even though entanglement appears instantaneous, it doesn’t allow for faster-than-light communication because it can’t transmit usable information. The result of a measurement on one particle is random, so observers on each end would need to compare results through classical means (which does happen at or below \( c \)) to verify entanglement.

3. **Implications for Spacetime**:
   - This suggests that entanglement might operate outside traditional spacetime constraints, implying a form of non-local connection that doesn't rely on conventional space or time. This is one reason why entanglement is often described as a "non-local" phenomenon.

In summary, while entanglement effects are immediate, they don’t violate relativity because they don't convey information faster than light. The underlying mechanism remains one of quantum mechanics' big mysteries, pointing toward a deep connection beyond our current understanding of space and time.
