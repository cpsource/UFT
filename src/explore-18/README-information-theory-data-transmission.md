Using **information theory**, you can think of transmitting **monopole** or **dipole** information as encoding and transferring specific properties of the system (e.g., charge, motion, field strengths, etc.) into signals that propagate across space and time. Here’s a breakdown of how monopole and dipole information could be transmitted:

---

### **1. Monopole Information**
A **monopole** represents a single, isolated source or sink of a field, like:
- **Charge monopole**: A single electric charge.
- **Mass monopole**: A single gravitational source.

#### **Information to Transmit**:
- **Position** (\( \vec{r} \)): The location of the monopole in space.
- **Magnitude** (\( q \) or \( m \)): The strength of the monopole’s charge or mass.
- **Time Dependency** (\( q(t) \)): Whether the monopole changes with time (e.g., decaying charge or moving mass).

#### **Transmission Methods**:
1. **Scalar Field Propagation**:
   - Transmit information via a **scalar field**, such as the electric potential \( \phi \) or gravitational potential \( \Phi \):
     \[
     \Phi(\vec{r}, t) \propto \frac{q}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0|}
     \]
   - The scalar field inherently propagates at the speed of light (\( c \)) in most physical contexts.

2. **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**:
   - Encode the magnitude of the monopole in the **amplitude** of a propagating wave.
   - Example: Modulate a scalar wave’s amplitude to encode \( q \) or \( m \).

3. **Pulse Transmission**:
   - Transmit the presence of a monopole as a series of discrete pulses (digital information).
   - Each pulse represents a packet of information about the monopole’s position or strength.

### **2. Dipole Information**
A **dipole** represents two closely linked sources of opposite field properties, like:
- **Electric Dipole**: A positive and negative charge separated by a distance.
- **Magnetic Dipole**: A current loop or intrinsic magnetic moment.

#### **Information to Transmit**:
- **Position** (\( \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2 \)): Locations of the two poles.
- **Orientation** (\( \vec{p} \)): The direction of the dipole moment.
- **Magnitude** (\( |\vec{p}| \)): Strength of the dipole.
- **Time Dependency** (\( \vec{p}(t) \)): How the dipole evolves over time (e.g., oscillating dipole).

#### **Transmission Methods**:
1. **Vector Field Propagation**:
   - Transmit information via a **vector field** representing the dipole moment:
     \[
     \vec{E}_{\text{dipole}} \propto \frac{3(\vec{p} \cdot \hat{r})\hat{r} - \vec{p}}{r^3}
     \]
   - Encode the dipole’s orientation (\( \vec{p} \)) and magnitude in the vector field components.

2. **Polarization Encoding**:
   - Use polarization (linear, circular, or elliptical) to encode the dipole’s orientation or oscillatory behavior.
   - Example: Transmit the oscillating dipole moment as circularly polarized electromagnetic waves.

3. **Harmonic Transmission**:
   - Dipoles, especially oscillating ones, naturally emit electromagnetic radiation.
   - Transmit information through the **frequency** and **phase** of the emitted wave, encoding the oscillation rate and alignment of the dipole.

4. **Directional Beaming**:
   - Encode the orientation of the dipole by transmitting energy preferentially along certain directions (beam pattern).
   - Example: A rotating dipole emits radiation strongest along its axis of rotation.

### **3. Comparison of Monopole vs. Dipole Transmission**
| **Property**        | **Monopole Transmission**                        | **Dipole Transmission**                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Field Type**      | Scalar Field (\( \Phi \))                       | Vector Field (\( \vec{E}, \vec{B} \))         |
| **Key Information** | Position, magnitude, time dependency            | Orientation, magnitude, oscillation frequency |
| **Modulation**      | Amplitude or pulse modulation                   | Frequency, polarization, or directional       |
| **Radiation**       | No natural radiation (static field)             | Emits radiation if oscillating                |

### **4. Combined Transmission Across Space-Time**
Using **information theory**, a generalized transmission system could:
1. **Encode Source Properties**:
   - Combine monopole and dipole information into a data packet.
   - Example: Encode \( q \), \( \vec{p} \), and their time evolution into a structured waveform.

2. **Use a Carrier Wave**:
   - Employ a propagating wave (e.g., electromagnetic wave) to carry this information across space-time.

3. **Local Reconstruction**:
   - At the receiver (\( P_2 \)), decode the transmitted signal to reconstruct the monopole or dipole properties.

---

### **Conclusion**
In your thought experiment, monopole and dipole information can be transmitted as **scalar** and **vector field perturbations**, respectively, encoded in modulated waveforms or directly through field propagation. The redundancy in Maxwell’s equations might be reinterpreted as transformations to extract dipole or higher-order behavior from simpler monopole information streams.
