You’re absolutely right to question this: the observer \( P_2 \) wouldn't necessarily see **oscillations** unless the charge at \( P_1 \) undergoes **periodic acceleration**. Let’s clarify exactly what \( P_2 \) would observe for different types of acceleration:

---

### **1. Uniform Acceleration**
If \( P_1 \) accelerates uniformly (e.g., steadily increasing its velocity in one direction):
- **Electric Field (\( \vec{E} \))**:
  - The electric field at \( P_2 \) will increase or decrease steadily over time, depending on the relative motion of \( P_1 \).
  - No oscillation is observed because the change in the field is monotonic (smooth and continuous).

- **Magnetic Field (\( \vec{B} \))**:
  - Similarly, the magnetic field would adjust smoothly in response to the increasing velocity of \( P_1 \).
  - Again, there’s no oscillation unless the motion of \( P_1 \) itself oscillates.

- **What \( P_2 \) Sees**:
  - An observer at \( P_2 \) would detect a steady increase or decrease in field strength over time, reflecting the uniform acceleration of \( P_1 \).

---

### **2. Periodic Acceleration (Oscillatory Motion)**
If \( P_1 \) undergoes periodic acceleration (e.g., vibrating back and forth or orbiting a point):
- **Electric Field (\( \vec{E} \))**:
  - The electric field at \( P_2 \) will oscillate in strength and direction because the motion of \( P_1 \) causes its position and velocity to vary sinusoidally.
  
- **Magnetic Field (\( \vec{B} \))**:
  - The magnetic field will also oscillate in response to the periodic changes in velocity and acceleration of \( P_1 \).

- **What \( P_2 \) Sees**:
  - An oscillating electric and magnetic field, which together propagate as an electromagnetic wave. This happens because periodic acceleration causes field disturbances that travel outward.

---

### **3. One-Time Acceleration (Impulse)**
If \( P_1 \) experiences a brief burst of acceleration (e.g., a sudden push or impulse):
- **Electric Field (\( \vec{E} \))**:
  - \( P_2 \) would detect a sudden change in the electric field corresponding to the acceleration.
  - After the impulse, the electric field would stabilize to match \( P_1 \)’s new velocity.

- **Magnetic Field (\( \vec{B} \))**:
  - Similarly, the magnetic field would show a sudden adjustment in strength and direction during the impulse and stabilize afterward.

- **What \( P_2 \) Sees**:
  - A transient change in the fields, followed by a steady-state condition.

---

### **Why Oscillations Occur in Specific Cases**
Oscillations are not an intrinsic feature of all acceleration but result from:
1. **Periodic Motion**:
   - If \( P_1 \)’s acceleration is periodic, \( P_2 \) observes oscillatory changes in the fields.
2. **Wave Propagation**:
   - Oscillatory changes in \( \vec{E} \) and \( \vec{B} \) propagate as electromagnetic waves if \( P_1 \)’s motion is periodic.

Without periodic acceleration, there are no oscillations. Instead, \( P_2 \) observes smooth, monotonic changes or one-time disturbances in the fields.

---

### **4. Insights on Uniform Acceleration**
For **uniform acceleration**, \( P_2 \) would see:
- **Increasing Fields**: Both electric and magnetic fields grow steadily due to the increasing velocity of \( P_1 \).
- **No Oscillations**: The fields would not oscillate unless \( P_1 \)’s acceleration itself oscillates.
- **Gravitational Analogy**: This is similar to how gravitational waves require changes in acceleration (quadrupole moments, not uniform motion) to be emitted.

---

### **Summary**
- **Uniform Acceleration**: \( P_2 \) observes steady increases in \( \vec{E} \) and \( \vec{B} \) with no oscillations.
- **Periodic Acceleration**: Oscillatory changes in \( \vec{E} \) and \( \vec{B} \) propagate as electromagnetic waves.
- **One-Time Acceleration**: \( P_2 \) observes a transient adjustment in the fields.

Oscillations are tied directly to the nature of \( P_1 \)’s motion, not merely the fact that it accelerates. Would you like to explore a mathematical example of these cases?
