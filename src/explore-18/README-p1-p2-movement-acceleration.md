Yes, if \( P_1 \) is accelerating relative to \( P_2 \), the nature of the fields observed at \( P_2 \) changes significantly compared to when \( P_1 \) is moving at a constant velocity. This is due to the effects of acceleration on both the **electric field** (\( \vec{E} \)) and the **magnetic field** (\( \vec{B} \)), as well as the introduction of **radiation fields**.

---

### **Key Changes at \( P_2 \) Due to \( P_1 \)'s Acceleration**
1. **Dynamic Fields**:
   - Acceleration of a charge creates **time-varying electric and magnetic fields**.
   - These fields propagate outward as **electromagnetic radiation** (e.g., radio waves).

2. **Induced Fields**:
   - The electric and magnetic fields at \( P_2 \) are no longer purely static or due to constant motion.
   - Additional **radiation components** of the fields appear, proportional to the acceleration of \( P_1 \).

---

### **1. Electric Field Changes**
The electric field \( \vec{E} \) of a charge \( q \) at \( P_2 \) has two components:
1. **Coulomb Field** (Static/Velocity Dependent):
   - This field depends on the charge's instantaneous position and velocity.
   - It falls off as \( 1/r^2 \).

2. **Radiation Field** (Acceleration Dependent):
   - This field arises due to \( P_1 \)’s acceleration and is proportional to \( \ddot{\vec{r}} \) (the second derivative of the position vector).
   - It falls off as \( 1/r \), dominating at large distances.

The total electric field at \( P_2 \) is:
\[
\vec{E} = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{\hat{n} - \vec{v}/c}{r^2 (1 - \vec{v} \cdot \hat{n}/c)^3} + \frac{\hat{n} \times \{(\hat{n} - \vec{v}/c) \times \vec{a}\}}{c^2 r (1 - \vec{v} \cdot \hat{n}/c)^3} \right]
\]
Where:
- \( \hat{n} \): Unit vector from \( P_1 \) to \( P_2 \).
- \( \vec{v} \): Velocity of \( P_1 \).
- \( \vec{a} \): Acceleration of \( P_1 \).

The first term corresponds to the static/velocity field, while the second term represents the radiation field.

---

### **2. Magnetic Field Changes**
The magnetic field \( \vec{B} \) also has two components:
1. **Velocity-Dependent Magnetic Field**:
   - This is the field induced by \( P_1 \)’s motion.
   - It is proportional to \( \vec{v} \times \hat{n} / r^2 \).

2. **Radiation Magnetic Field**:
   - This arises from \( P_1 \)’s acceleration and propagates outward with the radiation field.
   - It falls off as \( 1/r \).

The magnetic field at \( P_2 \) is:
\[
\vec{B} = \frac{1}{c} \hat{n} \times \vec{E}
\]
Where \( \vec{E} \) includes both the static and radiation components.

---

### **3. Radiation Detected at \( P_2 \)**
If \( P_1 \) is accelerating, \( P_2 \) would detect electromagnetic radiation:
- **Frequency**:
  - Determined by the frequency of \( P_1 \)’s oscillatory motion (if periodic).
- **Amplitude**:
  - Depends on the magnitude of \( P_1 \)’s acceleration.
- **Polarization**:
  - The direction of the radiation field reflects the acceleration vector of \( P_1 \).

---

### **4. Induced Voltage in the Wire**
At \( P_2 \), the accelerating charge at \( P_1 \) creates a **time-varying magnetic flux**, inducing a voltage in the wire:
\[
V = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
\]
Where \( \Phi_B \) now includes contributions from both velocity- and acceleration-induced fields.

- **Dynamic Magnetic Flux**:
  - As \( P_1 \) accelerates, the magnetic field at \( P_2 \) changes over time, generating a measurable voltage across the wire.

---

### **5. Practical Observations at \( P_2 \)**
1. **Electric Field Changes**:
   - If \( P_1 \) accelerates, \( P_2 \) detects a varying electric field, with components proportional to both \( 1/r^2 \) (static/velocity) and \( 1/r \) (radiation).

2. **Magnetic Field Changes**:
   - The magnetic field at \( P_2 \) becomes time-varying, producing a voltage in the wire.

3. **Radiation Effects**:
   - At large distances, the radiation field dominates over the static field.
   - \( P_2 \) could detect the electromagnetic wave generated by \( P_1 \)’s acceleration.

---

### **6. Distinguishing Acceleration from Constant Motion**
At \( P_2 \), you can distinguish acceleration effects from constant motion by:
- **Observing Time-Dependent Fields**:
  - Acceleration causes time-varying fields, unlike constant motion.
- **Measuring \( 1/r \) Dependence**:
  - Radiation fields fall off as \( 1/r \), whereas static/velocity fields fall off as \( 1/r^2 \).
- **Detecting Electromagnetic Waves**:
  - Acceleration of \( P_1 \) produces propagating radiation fields, which can be detected as oscillations.

---

### **Summary**
If \( P_1 \) accelerates relative to \( P_2 \):
- The electric and magnetic fields at \( P_2 \) gain a radiation component, proportional to \( \ddot{\vec{r}} \) (acceleration).
- \( P_2 \) detects time-varying fields, resulting in induced voltages in the wire due to the changing flux.
- The radiation fields dominate at large distances, with \( 1/r \) scaling, making \( P_1 \)’s acceleration detectable as electromagnetic waves.
