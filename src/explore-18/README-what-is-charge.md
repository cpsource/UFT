To define **charge** without relying on "magical constants" or predefined theories, we must approach it as an observable property of interactions, emerging from the underlying behavior of energy, motion, and sub-space distortions. Here's an exploration of how we might define charge, its range, and its forces:

---

### **1. Defining Charge**
#### **A. Charge as a Measure of Interaction**
- **Charge** can be defined as a property of a "thing" (e.g., a particle or an entity in sub-space) that describes its **ability to create and respond to distortions** in the surrounding medium (sub-space).
- The **polarity** (positive or negative) reflects the **directionality** of the distortion:
  - **Positive charge**: Represents a distortion that radiates outward (a "source").
  - **Negative charge**: Represents a distortion that converges inward (a "sink").
- The **magnitude** of the charge measures the intensity of this distortion.

#### **B. Interaction Mechanism**
- Charges interact by creating fields (regions of influence) in the surrounding sub-space. These fields overlap and affect each other:
  - **Like charges**: Distortions with the same direction (both outward or both inward) repel because they add energy to the medium when brought closer, increasing tension.
  - **Opposite charges**: Distortions in opposite directions (one inward, one outward) attract because they balance the medium's tension, reducing energy when brought closer.

#### **C. Why Charges Can Be + or -**
- Charge polarity arises from the **direction of the distortion** in sub-space:
  - This symmetry of directionality (inward vs. outward) naturally leads to the existence of two distinct types of charge.
  - These types are not intrinsic "positive" or "negative" properties but are relative to the medium's response.

---

### **2. Range of Charge**
#### **A. Effective Range**
- The range of the charge's influence depends on how far its distortion propagates in the surrounding medium before it dissipates:
  - Charges interact through fields that decrease in strength with distance (e.g., \( 1/r^2 \)).
  - The effective range is theoretically infinite in an ideal vacuum, but in real systems, the medium (sub-space) imposes limits based on energy dissipation and interference.

#### **B. Factors Affecting Range**
- **Density of the Medium**:
  - If the medium (sub-space) is denser, distortions attenuate faster, reducing the range of the charge.
- **Relative Motion**:
  - Moving charges (currents) can create additional distortions (magnetic effects), altering the range and strength of interaction.

---

### **3. Forces Between Charges**
#### **A. Mechanism of Force**
- The force between charges arises from the medium's tendency to minimize energy:
  - **Repulsion**: Like charges distort the medium in the same way, increasing tension and energy when brought closer. The medium resists this compression, producing a repulsive force.
  - **Attraction**: Opposite charges distort the medium in complementary ways, reducing tension and energy when brought closer. The medium relaxes, pulling the charges together.

#### **B. Mathematical Relationship**
- Without invoking Coulomb's Law, the force can be thought of as proportional to:
  \[
  F \propto \frac{\Delta D}{r^2}
  \]
  where:
  - \( \Delta D \): Difference in the distortion gradient caused by the interacting charges.
  - \( r^2 \): Distance between the charges, as the medium's influence spreads out over an area.

---

### **4. Symmetry of Attraction and Repulsion**
#### **A. Why Like Repel and Opposites Attract**
- The symmetry of charge interactions stems from the medium's energy dynamics:
  - **Repulsion**: Like charges push distortions in the same direction, amplifying the medium's stress and creating a force that drives them apart.
  - **Attraction**: Opposite charges pull distortions in opposite directions, relaxing the medium's stress and drawing them together.

#### **B. Energy Perspective**
- Attraction and repulsion can also be explained by the energy gradient:
  - Like charges move to minimize the energy they add to the medium by separating.
  - Opposite charges move to minimize energy by converging and canceling distortions.

---

### **5. Observables and Testable Predictions**
- **Field Dynamics**:
  - Charges generate observable field gradients in sub-space. The field strength and range depend on the charge magnitude and the properties of the medium.
- **Interaction Forces**:
  - The force between charges should vary with distance and medium density, measurable without invoking predefined constants.
- **Polarity Effects**:
  - The symmetry of attraction and repulsion can be tested by observing how charges dynamically stabilize in systems.

---

### **6. A Fresh Perspective on Charge**
Charge, in this view, is a **property of interaction** with sub-space:
- It represents the direction and magnitude of distortion in the medium.
- Polarity arises from symmetry in the medium's response.
- Forces between charges emerge naturally from the medium's effort to minimize tension and energy.

This explanation avoids invoking magical constants or predefined laws, instead framing charge as a consequence of the dynamics of sub-space distortions. Would you like to simulate or visualize how such distortions might work?
