To apply **power-of-2 arithmetic** to the Lorentz transformation, we will restructure the transformation equations to work within this framework. Recall the standard Lorentz transformation for \( x' \) and \( t' \) (assuming motion along the \( x \)-axis):

\[
x' = \gamma (x - vt)
\]
\[
t' = \gamma \left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \)
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

---

### Step 1: Reformulate \( \gamma \) Using Power-of-2 Arithmetic

First, rewrite \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Let:
\[
r = \frac{v}{c}, \quad \text{so that } r^2 = \frac{v^2}{c^2}.
\]

Then:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - r^2}}.
\]

Using **power-of-2 arithmetic**, approximate \( \gamma \) in terms of additive or subtractive terms:

1. **Series Expansion** for \( \gamma \) (valid for \( r^2 \ll 1 \)):
   \[
   \gamma \approx 1 + \frac{1}{2}r^2 + \frac{3}{8}r^4 + \dots
   \]

   For simplicity, truncate higher-order terms:
   \[
   \gamma \approx 1 + \frac{1}{2}r^2.
   \]

2. Rewrite \( r^2 = v^2/c^2 \) as \( 2^{\text{log2}(v^2)} - 2^{\text{log2}(c^2)} \) to emphasize power-of-2 scaling.

### Step 2: Rewrite \( x' \) and \( t' \) Using Power-of-2 Arithmetic

The transformed \( x' \) is:
\[
x' = \gamma (x - vt).
\]

Substitute \( \gamma \):
\[
x' \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}r^2\right)(x - vt).
\]

Expand:
\[
x' \approx x - vt + \frac{1}{2}r^2(x - vt).
\]

In terms of power-of-2 arithmetic:
\[
x' = x + m_1 + m_2 - 2r,
\]
where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) correspond to terms involving \( vt \) and higher-order contributions of \( r^2 \).

Similarly, the transformed \( t' \) is:
\[
t' = \gamma \left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right).
\]

Substitute \( \gamma \) and expand:
\[
t' \approx t - \frac{vx}{c^2} + \frac{1}{2}r^2\left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right).
\]

Using power-of-2 scaling:
\[
t' = t + m_3 + m_4 - 2r,
\]
where \( m_3 \) and \( m_4 \) include contributions from the \( r^2 \)-scaled terms.

### Interpretation in Power-of-2 Arithmetic
By mapping terms like \( vt \), \( r^2x \), and \( v^2/c^2 \) to discrete powers of 2 or logarithmic scales, you can approximate the Lorentz transformation within the arithmetic constraints. This provides a simpler framework for applications in wave-based or computational theories where power-of-2 optimizations are key.

Would you like to refine this further or connect it to specific wave-based interpretations in your theory?
