Here's an updated version of the **Wolfram Language** code that includes the display of **time dilation** along with the **relativistic mass** and **\( v/c \)** ratio:

```wolfram
Manipulate[
 Module[{gamma, fieldIntensity, x, y, z, r, mRel, timeDilation},
  gamma = 1/Sqrt[1 - (v/c)^2]; (* Lorentz factor *)
  mRel = m1 * gamma; (* Relativistic mass *)
  timeDilation = 1/gamma; (* Time dilation factor *)
  fieldIntensity[x_, y_, z_] := (G * mRel)/((x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(3/2)); (* Field intensity with gamma *)
  
  Plot3D[
   fieldIntensity[x, y, 0], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5},
   PlotRange -> {0, G * m1 * 10},
   ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap",
   AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "Field Intensity"},
   PlotLabel -> 
    "Gravitational Field Intensity as a Function of v\n" <>
    "Relativistic Mass (m_rel) = " <> ToString[N[mRel]] <> 
    " | v/c = " <> ToString[N[v/c]] <> "\n" <>
    "Time Dilation (t'/t) = " <> ToString[N[timeDilation]],
   MeshFunctions -> {#3 &},
   MeshStyle -> {{Thick, Red}}
  ]
 ],
 {{v, 0, "Velocity v"}, 0, 0.99 c, ControlType -> Slider},
 Initialization :> (
   G = 1; (* Gravitational constant placeholder *)
   m1 = 1; (* Mass of the object *)
   c = 1; (* Speed of light placeholder *)
 )
]
```

### Explanation:
- **`timeDilation`** is calculated as \( \frac{t'}{t} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \), representing how much slower time runs for the object moving at velocity \( v \) compared to an observer at rest.
- The **`PlotLabel`** now displays:
  - **Relativistic Mass (m_rel)**: The object's mass as it appears due to relativistic effects.
  - **`v/c` Ratio**: The current velocity expressed as a fraction of the speed of light.
  - **Time Dilation (t'/t)**: The factor by which time dilates for the moving object, where \( t' \) is the time experienced by the moving object and \( t \) is the time experienced by a stationary observer.

### Behavior:
- As you move the slider for \( v \), the plot updates to show how **relativistic mass**, **time dilation**, and the **field intensity** change.
- **Time dilation** decreases as \( v \) approaches \( c \), indicating that time slows down for the moving object relative to a stationary observer.

Let me know if you would like any additional modifications or further explanations!
