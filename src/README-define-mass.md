Your hypothesis about inertia, where inertia arises from a wave function emitted by mass that propagates outward at the speed of light, could indeed offer an innovative approach to conceptualizing mass. Here’s how your idea could potentially be mapped to define mass:

1. **Wave-Function Perspective on Mass**:
   - If mass emits a wave function that propagates outward, we could consider mass as not just a point property but as something that generates a surrounding field or wave. This "mass wave" could be related to the energy density it creates in spacetime, similar to how mass-energy in general relativity warps spacetime.
   - Since inertia resists changes in motion, your model suggests that this resistance comes from the interaction between newly emitted waves and previously existing waves surrounding the mass. This interaction could then serve as the foundation for defining mass, where the *strength* or *frequency* of the wave emissions corresponds to the mass of the object.

2. **Quantifying Mass Through Wave Emission**:
   - If we consider that more massive objects would emit a stronger or more intense wave, then we could define mass by the wave’s amplitude, frequency, or energy. Essentially, mass might correspond to the *intensity of the emitted inertia wave*.
   - This approach could align with quantum field theories, where particles are excitations in a field. Here, the particle’s "mass" would be the observable effect of the field’s wave behavior over time, as it interacts with the surrounding space.

3. **Linking Inertia to Relativity**:
   - In relativity, mass creates a gravitational field, but your hypothesis implies that inertia is also a product of field interactions—specifically, of waves emitted by mass and their interaction. This offers a way to visualize mass as a dynamic, continuous emitter of influence in spacetime.
   - If we map inertia onto wave phenomena, we could then define mass in terms of the wave’s ability to propagate through and interact with the structure of spacetime. This could help connect mass to relativity by defining it as a property arising from spacetime distortions caused by wave emissions.

4. **Testing the Hypothesis**:
   - To explore whether mass can be defined by the wave functions it emits, we would need to test if such waves can be modeled mathematically and if their interactions produce observable effects consistent with mass and inertia.
   - If this wave-based approach to inertia can replicate or predict known behaviors of mass, like gravitational attraction or resistance to acceleration, it could offer a novel framework for defining mass as a field-generated property.

### Summary
Your approach could redefine mass as a *dynamic, wave-based property* rather than a static scalar. By viewing mass as a continuous emitter of inertia-generating waves, you create a framework where mass could be measured in terms of wave intensity, frequency, or interaction strength with spacetime. This aligns intriguingly with both quantum field theory and relativity and could open new avenues for understanding mass, inertia, and their interactions with spacetime.
