Gravitational potential energy depends on the **distance** between two objects because gravity is a force that weakens with distance. Specifically, gravitational potential energy decreases (becomes more negative) as two masses are brought closer together, and it approaches zero as they move infinitely far apart.

### Why Gravitational Potential Energy Depends on Distance

The formula for gravitational potential energy between two masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is:

\[
U = -\frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( r \) is the distance between the two masses.

The **inverse relationship** between \( U \) and \( r \) (specifically, \( 1/r \)) means that:
- **As \( r \) increases** (i.e., as the objects move farther apart), the potential energy \( U \) becomes **less negative**, approaching zero. This implies that at infinitely large distances, gravitational potential energy approaches zero.
- **As \( r \) decreases** (i.e., as the objects move closer together), \( U \) becomes **more negative**, indicating a stronger gravitational "binding" between the two masses.

### Potential Energy at Different Distances

Letâ€™s look at the gravitational potential energy between two iron atoms with mass \( m \approx 9.2736 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \) at different distances:

1. **At \( r = 1 \, \text{m} \)**: (as calculated previously)
   \[
   U \approx -3.582 \times 10^{-42} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. **At \( r = 1000 \, \text{m} \) (1 kilometer)**:
   Using \( r = 1000 \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   U = -\frac{G \cdot m^2}{1000} = \frac{-5.7395 \times 10^{-61}}{1000} \approx -5.7395 \times 10^{-64} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (eV):
   \[
   U \approx \frac{-5.7395 \times 10^{-64} \, \text{J}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx -3.582 \times 10^{-45} \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **At \( r = \infty \) (infinite separation)**:
   \[
   U = -\frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{\infty} = 0
   \]

Thus, as the distance between two masses increases, the gravitational potential energy becomes less negative, eventually approaching zero at infinite separation.

### Physical Interpretation

This relationship shows that gravitational potential energy is always **negative** for any finite distance \( r \), indicating that work is required to separate the two masses against the gravitational pull until they are infinitely far apart, where the potential energy reaches zero. 

### Summary of Gravitational Potential Energy Dependence on Distance

1. **Closer Together**: The potential energy is more negative, reflecting a stronger gravitational attraction.
2. **Farther Apart**: The potential energy becomes less negative, meaning weaker gravitational attraction.
3. **At Infinity**: The potential energy reaches zero, meaning the objects no longer exert gravitational influence on each other.

In practical terms, gravitational potential energy is significant only at large scales (e.g., planets, stars) due to the relatively small value of \( G \) and becomes negligible at atomic or molecular scales compared to other forces, such as electromagnetic forces.
