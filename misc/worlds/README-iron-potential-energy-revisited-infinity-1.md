To calculate the gravitational potential energy between two iron atoms, considering the separation distance as the approximate radius of their electron "cloud" or field, we need to estimate that radius and then apply the gravitational potential energy formula.

For an iron atom, the electron field or effective atomic radius is typically around **1 to 2 Ångströms (Å)**, where \( 1 \, \text{Å} = 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Set the Distance \( r \)

We'll use the radius of the electron field as the distance between the centers of the two atoms. For an iron atom, let’s choose:
\[
r = 1 \, \text{Å} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Gravitational Potential Energy Formula

The gravitational potential energy \( U \) between two masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) separated by distance \( r \) is:

\[
U = -\frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \),
- \( m_1 = m_2 = m \) is the mass of an iron atom, approximately \( 9.2736 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( r = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( U \) at \( r = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

1. **Compute \( m_1 \cdot m_2 \)**:
   \[
   m_1 \cdot m_2 = (9.2736 \times 10^{-26})^2 = 8.6011 \times 10^{-51} \, \text{kg}^2
   \]

2. **Plug Values into the Formula**:
   \[
   U = -\frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (8.6011 \times 10^{-51})}{1 \times 10^{-10}}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( U \)**:
   \[
   U = -6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 8.6011 \times 10^{-41}
   \]
   \[
   U = -5.739 \times 10^{-51} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert to Electron Volts

To express \( U \) in electron volts (eV), where \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
U = \frac{-5.739 \times 10^{-51} \, \text{J}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}}
\]

\[
U \approx -3.584 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Final Answer

The gravitational potential energy between two iron atoms, assuming a separation distance of around \( 1 \, \text{Å} \) (the approximate radius of the electron cloud), is:

\[
U \approx -3.584 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{eV}
\]

This extremely small energy demonstrates that gravitational effects are negligible between individual atoms compared to other interactions, such as electromagnetic forces, at atomic scales.
