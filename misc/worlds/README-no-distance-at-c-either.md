Yes, that’s correct! From the perspective of a particle moving at the speed of light (such as a **photon**), **both time and distance collapse to zero**. This is one of the fascinating consequences of relativity and the way spacetime behaves for particles traveling at \( c \):

### 1. **No Passage of Time**

For a particle moving at \( c \):
- **Time dilation** becomes infinite, meaning that time does not pass for the particle. From its own "perspective" (if such a perspective could exist), the journey between any two points in space happens instantaneously.
- This timelessness implies that, in a photon's frame, there is no duration between its emission and absorption. The entire journey from start to finish occurs in zero time.

### 2. **No Perceived Distance**

If time does not pass for the photon, then **distance also collapses** for it:
- According to relativity, space and time are interwoven in such a way that they both transform together. If the time between two events (emission and absorption) is zero from the photon’s frame, then the spatial separation must also be zero.
- This is because, for light, the **space-time interval** (the combined measure of space and time distance in relativity) between any two points on its path is always zero. In relativistic terms, light travels along what’s called a **null geodesic**—a path in spacetime where the interval is zero.

So, for the photon, there is no "distance" in the conventional sense between its point of emission and its point of absorption.

### 3. **How This Fits into Relativity**

In relativity, **distance and time are relative** and depend on the observer:
- For an observer at rest relative to the path of the photon (e.g., a scientist measuring the light’s journey from a distant star to Earth), there is a measurable distance and a measurable duration. This observer would measure the time taken for light to travel this distance at a speed of \( c \).
- For the photon itself, however, the situation is entirely different. Because it experiences no time, it also "experiences" no spatial separation between its starting and ending points.

In other words, **distance and time become inseparable** in the context of light’s motion. From the photon’s perspective, the universe is "compressed" to zero in the direction of travel, making the emission and absorption points effectively the same location.

### 4. **Implications of Zero Spacetime Interval**

This zero interval has deep implications:
- **Events Along Light’s Path**: Any two events that happen to a photon, such as emission and absorption, are separated by a **spacetime interval of zero**. This is what makes light’s trajectory unique and distinct from that of particles with mass.
- **Unification of Points**: For light, the beginning and end points along its path are unified in spacetime, which is why photons appear to traverse vast distances from the perspective of an outside observer but experience none of that distance themselves.

### Summary

- **No Time**: For a photon moving at \( c \), time does not pass between emission and absorption.
- **No Distance**: Since time and space are interconnected, the absence of time implies the absence of distance in the photon's frame.
- **Null Geodesic**: Light travels along a path with a spacetime interval of zero, meaning that its entire journey collapses to a single "point" from its perspective.

So, in summary, **for light, both time and distance become meaningless** in the conventional sense. Its journey from one point to another is experienced as instantaneous and without spatial separation—an effect that beautifully illustrates the counterintuitive nature of relativity.
