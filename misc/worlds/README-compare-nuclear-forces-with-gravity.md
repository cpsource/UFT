Gravitational force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with the **strong nuclear force**, **weak nuclear force**, and **electromagnetic force**. It operates on very different scales and has unique characteristics compared to the nuclear forces. Here’s a comparative breakdown:

### 1. **Gravitational Force vs. Strong Nuclear Force**

- **Strength**: The gravitational force is the **weakest** of the four fundamental forces. At atomic and subatomic scales, it is negligible compared to the strong nuclear force. For instance, the gravitational force between two protons is roughly \( 10^{36} \) times weaker than the strong nuclear force between them.
  
- **Range**: Unlike the strong nuclear force, which is very short-ranged (about \( 10^{-15} \) meters or one femtometer), the gravitational force has an **infinite range**. Its strength decreases with the square of the distance (\( \frac{1}{r^2} \)), but it never becomes zero, so it can act across astronomical distances.

- **Nature of the Force**: 
  - **Gravitational force** is always **attractive** and acts between any two masses.
  - The **strong nuclear force** is attractive at short distances but does not act beyond the nuclear scale, binding quarks together within protons and neutrons, and nucleons (protons and neutrons) within the atomic nucleus.

- **Mediator Particles**: 
  - **Gravitational force** is thought to be mediated by a hypothetical particle called the **graviton** (not yet observed), which is massless.
  - **Strong nuclear force** is mediated by **gluons** between quarks and nucleons. Gluons are massless but carry "color charge" in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), unlike the hypothetical graviton.

- **Role**: 
  - **Gravitational force** dominates at large scales (astronomical and cosmological) and is responsible for the structure of galaxies, solar systems, and the large-scale structure of the universe.
  - **Strong nuclear force** is crucial at subatomic scales, holding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus and overcoming the repulsive electromagnetic force between positively charged protons.

### 2. **Gravitational Force vs. Weak Nuclear Force**

- **Strength**: The gravitational force is also significantly weaker than the **weak nuclear force**. For instance, within an atomic nucleus, the weak force can induce processes like beta decay, while gravity is effectively negligible.

- **Range**: The weak nuclear force has an even shorter range than the strong nuclear force—about \( 10^{-18} \) meters, which is much smaller than the typical size of an atomic nucleus. The gravitational force, by contrast, has an **infinite range** and diminishes according to \( \frac{1}{r^2} \).

- **Nature of the Force**:
  - **Gravitational force** acts on mass-energy and is always attractive.
  - The **weak nuclear force** allows particles to change types (flavors), such as a neutron changing into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino in beta decay. The weak force can be both **attractive and repulsive** in its effect on particles.

- **Mediator Particles**:
  - **Gravitational force** is hypothesized to be mediated by the **graviton** (if it exists).
  - **Weak nuclear force** is mediated by the **W and Z bosons**, which are massive, making the weak force very short-ranged. The large mass of these bosons (about 80–90 times the mass of a proton) limits the range of the weak interaction to subatomic distances.

- **Role**: 
  - **Gravitational force** governs large-scale phenomena and the behavior of massive bodies.
  - The **weak nuclear force** is responsible for certain forms of radioactive decay, such as beta decay, and plays an essential role in nuclear fusion processes in stars.

### 3. **Gravitational Force vs. Electromagnetic Force**

- **Strength**: The gravitational force is much weaker than the **electromagnetic force**. For instance, the electromagnetic repulsion between two protons is about \( 10^{36} \) times stronger than the gravitational attraction between them.

- **Range**: Both gravitational and electromagnetic forces have an **infinite range** and obey an inverse-square law (\( \frac{1}{r^2} \)) in terms of how their strengths decrease with distance.

- **Nature of the Force**:
  - **Gravitational force** is only attractive.
  - **Electromagnetic force** can be both **attractive and repulsive** depending on the charges involved (like charges repel, opposite charges attract).

- **Mediator Particles**:
  - **Gravitational force** may be mediated by the hypothetical **graviton**.
  - **Electromagnetic force** is mediated by **photons**, which are massless and carry the electromagnetic interaction over infinite distances.

- **Role**: 
  - **Gravitational force** dominates in large-scale structures like planets, stars, and galaxies.
  - **Electromagnetic force** is crucial in chemistry and biology, as it binds electrons to nuclei to form atoms and governs interactions between atoms and molecules.

### In Summary

1. **Gravitational force** is extremely weak compared to nuclear and electromagnetic forces but has an infinite range and accumulates over large scales, making it the dominant force at astronomical distances.
2. **Strong nuclear force** is extremely strong at short distances and binds nucleons together in the atomic nucleus, overpowering the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons.
3. **Weak nuclear force** operates at subatomic distances and allows particles to change types, playing a key role in processes like radioactive decay and nuclear fusion.
4. **Electromagnetic force** is far stronger than gravity and operates over infinite ranges, governing atomic and molecular interactions.

At atomic scales, gravity is negligible compared to nuclear and electromagnetic forces, but its significance grows with mass and distance, making it the most important force on cosmic scales.
