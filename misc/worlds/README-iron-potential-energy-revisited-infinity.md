You're correct in observing that gravitational potential energy reflects the **total amount of work needed** to bring two masses from an infinite separation (where gravitational potential energy is defined as zero) to a given finite distance, \( r \). Letâ€™s clarify why the gravitational potential energy itself still depends on distance, even though we're not focusing on the force per se.

### Gravitational Potential Energy as Accumulated Work

Gravitational potential energy represents the **work done** to move a mass from infinity to a specific distance \( r \) from another mass. This work is cumulative, as you mentioned, and it accounts for all the infinitesimal work contributions as we bring the masses closer together. 

The gravitational potential energy \( U \) at a distance \( r \) from a mass \( M \) can be understood as the sum of all infinitesimal energy contributions:

\[
U = -\int_{\infty}^{r} F \, dr = -\int_{\infty}^{r} \frac{G M m}{r^2} \, dr
\]

where \( F = \frac{G M m}{r^2} \) is the gravitational force at distance \( r \).

### Evaluating the Integral

When we evaluate this integral, we get:

\[
U = -\frac{G M m}{r}
\]

So, the **total potential energy** at distance \( r \) is the accumulated effect of all the infinitesimal energy contributions as the masses move from infinity to \( r \). This potential energy becomes more negative as \( r \) decreases, indicating that we have released energy by bringing the masses closer.

### Why Potential Energy Depends on Distance

The reason gravitational potential energy depends on \( r \) is that this accumulated energy reflects the depth of the gravitational "well" at distance \( r \). The closer the masses are, the more negative (i.e., the "deeper") the gravitational potential energy becomes. This cumulative energy is greater in magnitude (more negative) because we've applied more work over a greater "distance" in the gravitational field.

- **At infinity** (\( r \to \infty \)): The potential energy is zero, because no work has been done to bring the masses together.
- **At a finite distance \( r \)**: The potential energy is negative, reflecting the energy released in bringing the masses from infinity to \( r \).
- **Closer distances**: The potential energy becomes increasingly negative, reflecting the increasing gravitational "binding" between the two masses.

### Key Point: Potential Energy as Total Work Accumulated

So, while the force indeed decreases with distance, the gravitational potential energy remains distance-dependent because it represents the **total work required to assemble the system** from infinite separation to the given distance. The more we decrease \( r \), the more work has been effectively "released" (as negative potential energy) into the system, creating a stronger binding between the two masses.

This is why gravitational potential energy, like potential energies in other inverse-square fields (such as electrostatics), is inherently **distance-dependent** despite representing the cumulative work across all distances.
