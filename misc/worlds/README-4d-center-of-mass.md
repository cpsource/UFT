Yes, a solid 4D cube (also known as a **tesseract**) would indeed have a center of mass if it were uniformly dense. The concept of the center of mass generalizes to any number of dimensions, so a 4D object with uniform density can have a well-defined center of mass just like 3D, 2D, or 1D objects.

### How the Center of Mass Works in 4D

For a 4D tesseract with uniform mass distribution, the center of mass would be located at the "average" position of all its points in the four-dimensional space. Specifically:

1. **Geometric Center**: The center of mass of a solid 4D tesseract would be located at the midpoint of each of its 4D coordinates, assuming it’s centered around the origin. For example, if the tesseract’s vertices range from \( -a \) to \( +a \) along each of the \( w \), \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) axes, then the center of mass would be at \( (0, 0, 0, 0) \).

2. **Calculation of Center of Mass**: Mathematically, for an \( n \)-dimensional object, the center of mass can be found by taking the average of the coordinates of all points within the object. In a uniformly dense tesseract, this calculation simplifies to the midpoint of the object in each of the four dimensions.

3. **Physical Interpretation**: If you could imagine "balancing" a solid 4D tesseract, its center of mass would be the point at which it could theoretically be balanced in 4D space.

### Visualizing the 4D Center of Mass

In lower-dimensional projections, we might represent the center of mass as a point within the 3D or 2D projection of the tesseract. However, in 4D, this point is simply a position where all four coordinates are at the midpoint of the object’s extent, providing a "center" in four-dimensional space.

So, while we can't directly observe a 4D center of mass, mathematically, it exists and behaves analogously to centers of mass in 3D and lower dimensions.
