Yes, if multiple iron atoms were converging on a single iron atom, you would indeed accumulate additional gravitational potential energy. For \( N \) iron atoms converging on one atom, the total gravitational potential energy would approximately be \( N \) times the potential energy of a single pair of iron atoms, assuming all of them are at the same distance from the central atom.

However, the calculation becomes more complex if each of the \( N \) atoms is interacting gravitationally with every other atom in the cluster, not just the central atom. In this more general case, we need to consider the **pairwise gravitational potential energy** between every unique pair of atoms.

### Gravitational Potential Energy with Multiple Atoms

If you have \( N \) atoms in a cluster, the total gravitational potential energy \( U_{\text{total}} \) can be calculated by summing the potential energy for each unique pair of atoms, given by:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i < j} -\frac{G \cdot m_i \cdot m_j}{r_{ij}}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( m_i \) and \( m_j \) are the masses of atoms \( i \) and \( j \) (all equal for iron atoms).
- \( r_{ij} \) is the distance between atoms \( i \) and \( j \).

### Simplified Case: If All Atoms Are at the Same Distance from a Central Atom

If \( N \) atoms are arranged symmetrically around a central atom, each at the same distance \( r \) from it, then the total gravitational potential energy \( U_{\text{total}} \) between the central atom and the \( N \) surrounding atoms is approximately:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = N \cdot U_{\text{single pair}} = N \cdot \left(-\frac{G \cdot m^2}{r}\right)
\]

where \( U_{\text{single pair}} \) is the gravitational potential energy between one atom and the central atom.

So, if we take our previous result for a single pair of iron atoms at a distance of 1 Ångström:

\[
U_{\text{single pair}} \approx -3.584 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{eV}
\]

Then, for \( N = 10 \) atoms surrounding a central atom at the same distance, the potential energy is:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = 10 \cdot (-3.584 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{eV}) = -3.584 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( N = 100 \) atoms:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = 100 \cdot (-3.584 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{eV}) = -3.584 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Full Pairwise Potential Energy in a Cluster of \( N \) Atoms

For a more accurate calculation, we would sum the gravitational potential energy for each pair of atoms. In a cluster of \( N \) atoms, the number of unique pairs is given by \( \binom{N}{2} = \frac{N(N - 1)}{2} \). Therefore, if each pair of atoms has the same separation distance \( r \), the total gravitational potential energy in the cluster would be:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = \frac{N(N - 1)}{2} \cdot U_{\text{single pair}}
\]

Using this approach, you can see that the gravitational potential energy grows quadratically with the number of atoms, as each pairwise interaction contributes to the total energy. However, even with many atoms, gravitational energy at atomic distances remains extremely small compared to other forces, like electromagnetic interactions.
