Bolting something down in space is a bit different from securing it on Earth because space is inherently dynamic, and there’s no fixed "ground" or absolute reference point. However, it is possible to secure objects relative to each other in space. Here’s how it works and what it means for an object’s "position":

### 1. **Relative Positioning with Bolting and Anchoring**

In the context of space missions and structures (such as satellites, the International Space Station, or spacecraft), "bolting" or anchoring objects is feasible by **securing one object relative to another**. For example:
- **Inside a Spacecraft**: Tools, instruments, and equipment can be bolted to the interior of a spacecraft or space station, ensuring they stay in place relative to the structure of that vehicle.
- **On the Exterior of Spacecraft**: When astronauts perform spacewalks, they attach equipment to the exterior of the spacecraft using bolts, anchors, or tethers. This keeps tools and modules secure relative to the structure of the space station or spacecraft.

In both cases, bolting works well because it establishes a fixed **relative position** between the bolted items and the main structure, which acts as the "reference frame."

### 2. **Position and Motion in Space: No Absolute Frame of Reference**

Even though an object can be bolted down within a spacecraft or a space station, **the entire structure itself is constantly moving** relative to other objects in space. For example:
- The **International Space Station (ISS)** orbits Earth at about 7.66 kilometers per second.
- Earth itself orbits the Sun at roughly 30 kilometers per second.
- The **solar system** moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 220 kilometers per second.

This means that, while objects can have fixed positions relative to each other within a structure (like a spacecraft), **their absolute positions in space are constantly changing** due to the larger movements of their surroundings. In space, position is always defined relative to some chosen frame of reference because there is no universal "stationary" frame.

### 3. **Microgravity and Free-Floating Objects**

In microgravity environments, objects that aren’t bolted down will **free-float** due to the absence of a significant gravitational anchor (like on Earth). If you leave an object unbolted on the ISS, it will stay at rest or drift slowly, depending on small air currents or movements within the station. However, objects bolted down remain fixed in position relative to the ISS’s structure.

### 4. **Bolting to Celestial Bodies (e.g., Asteroids or the Moon)**

If you’re on the surface of a celestial body, like the Moon or an asteroid, bolting something down is possible as well, but with certain considerations:
- On the Moon, with about 1/6th of Earth’s gravity, objects can be bolted to the lunar surface using drills or anchors, as the Apollo missions did with scientific instruments.
- On an asteroid, where gravity is extremely weak, securing an object would require careful anchoring or drilling because there’s barely any gravitational pull to keep things grounded. Anchors that dig into the surface or use harpoons are often proposed for securing instruments on low-gravity bodies.

### 5. **Dynamic Positioning in Space Structures**

For larger structures like potential future space stations or satellites, bolting components together is critical for **structural integrity** and to ensure everything moves as a single unit. However, space structures may still require **constant adjustments** due to:
   - **Orbital decay**: Satellites in low-Earth orbit gradually lose altitude due to atmospheric drag and must periodically adjust their position.
   - **External forces**: Solar radiation pressure, gravitational influences from other bodies, and tiny impacts from micrometeoroids can affect the orientation or position of spacecraft over time, requiring adjustments to maintain their desired position.

### Summary

Yes, you can "bolt down" or secure objects in space relative to each other within a structure or relative to a celestial body. However, in a broader sense:
- **Position in space is always relative**; even a "bolted" object is moving along with the structure or celestial body it’s attached to.
- In microgravity, bolting down is crucial to prevent objects from drifting freely within the spacecraft.
- Larger structures and spacecraft may still need adjustments due to environmental influences, even if individual components are bolted together.

In essence, bolting establishes a stable relative position within a chosen frame, even though the absolute position of everything in space is always in flux.
