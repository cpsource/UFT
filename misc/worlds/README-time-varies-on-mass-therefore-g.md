Yes, in relativity, **time is not an absolute quantity** that ticks uniformly across the universe. Instead, time is relative and can vary depending on factors such as **velocity** and **gravitational field strength**. This idea, which is a core feature of both special and general relativity, means that time is experienced differently by different observers, depending on their states of motion or position in a gravitational field. Here’s how time varies "all over the place" in different contexts:

### 1. **Time Dilation in Special Relativity**

In special relativity, **time dilation** occurs because the rate at which time passes depends on an observer’s velocity:
- **Moving Clocks Run Slow**: For an observer moving at a high speed relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly. This means that if you’re on a fast-moving spaceship, less time will pass for you compared to someone who remains on Earth. 
- **Example**: If astronauts were to travel close to the speed of light, they would age more slowly compared to people on Earth. This phenomenon is sometimes called the **twin paradox**—a twin traveling at near-light speed would return younger than their twin who stayed behind.

Thus, time dilation means that the passage of time is **relative** to each observer’s motion, and there is no single “correct” rate of time that applies universally.

### 2. **Gravitational Time Dilation in General Relativity**

In general relativity, **gravitational time dilation** shows that time also depends on the strength of the gravitational field:
- **Stronger Gravity Slows Time**: Near a massive object, like a planet or a black hole, time slows down relative to a region with weaker gravity. This means that clocks closer to the Earth’s surface tick slightly slower than clocks higher up, where Earth’s gravitational pull is weaker.
- **Extreme Example Near Black Holes**: Near the event horizon of a black hole, time dilation becomes extreme. For an observer far from the black hole, it would appear that time nearly stops for someone hovering just above the event horizon.

This effect means that time does not pass uniformly across space but instead **varies with gravitational field strength**, creating different rates of time across different regions of the universe.

### 3. **Relative Nature of Simultaneity**

In relativity, the concept of **simultaneity** (whether two events happen at the same time) also becomes relative:
- **Different Observers, Different “Now”**: Observers moving at different velocities or positioned differently in a gravitational field will disagree on whether two spatially separated events occurred at the same time. This concept is called the **relativity of simultaneity**.
- **Example**: Two lightning strikes hitting opposite ends of a moving train may appear simultaneous to a stationary observer on the ground, but not to an observer on the train. The observer on the train might see one lightning strike before the other due to their motion.

Because simultaneity is relative, there’s no single “universal clock” that governs all events in the universe. Instead, each observer experiences their own **time frame** that can differ from others.

### 4. **Cosmic Scale: The Expansion of the Universe**

On a cosmological scale, **time is affected by the expanding universe**:
- **Cosmic Time vs. Local Time**: In cosmology, we often define a "cosmic time" that assumes the universe’s expansion rate as experienced by galaxies receding from each other. However, local time still varies depending on gravity and motion.
- **Redshift and Time**: Light from distant galaxies is redshifted, which is partly a result of time dilation effects due to the universe’s expansion. This redshift can be thought of as a measure of how time in distant regions of the universe appears “stretched” relative to our local frame.

### 5. **Practical Implications of Time Variation**

The variability of time has important practical applications:
- **Global Positioning System (GPS)**: GPS satellites orbiting Earth experience both special and gravitational time dilation. Since they move quickly relative to the Earth’s surface and are in a weaker gravitational field, their clocks tick slightly faster than clocks on Earth. GPS systems have to account for this time difference to provide accurate location data.
- **Clocks on Airplanes**: Atomic clocks on airplanes tick slightly differently than clocks on the ground due to both their speed and their altitude (gravitational time dilation). Experiments with atomic clocks have confirmed this time variation over and over again.

### 6. **Relative Time in Everyday Life**

While these relativistic effects are generally minuscule at the scales of everyday life, they are measurable and significant over large distances, high speeds, or strong gravitational fields. The key takeaways are:
- **Time is not universal**; it depends on the observer’s velocity and gravitational environment.
- Each observer has their own **proper time**, which is specific to their frame of reference.
- **Time variation** has real-world effects, such as time dilation for astronauts or timing adjustments in satellite systems.

### Summary

In relativity, **time is flexible** and varies throughout the universe based on motion and gravity:
1. **Time Dilation**: Motion at high speeds causes time to slow down for the moving observer.
2. **Gravitational Time Dilation**: Stronger gravitational fields slow down time.
3. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: Different observers may disagree on the timing of events, meaning simultaneity is relative.
4. **Cosmic Scale Effects**: Time appears to “stretch” across the universe due to cosmic expansion.

In short, relativity reveals that time is not absolute but instead "varies all over the place" depending on context. This fundamentally challenges our classical understanding of time, showing that it is not a single, universal flow but rather a dynamic, relative aspect of the fabric of spacetime.
