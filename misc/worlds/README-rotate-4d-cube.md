Rotating a 4D cube (or tesseract) involves rotating it within a four-dimensional space, which adds complexity compared to 3D rotation. In 3D, we rotate objects along three possible planes (XY, XZ, and YZ). In 4D, we add an extra dimension, so there are six possible planes of rotation, each involving a pair of the four coordinates.

### Planes of Rotation in 4D

In 4D space, rotations occur in planes formed by pairs of the four axes (usually labeled as \( w \), \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \)). The six possible planes of rotation are:

1. **WX-plane**: Rotation between the \( w \) and \( x \) axes.
2. **WY-plane**: Rotation between the \( w \) and \( y \) axes.
3. **WZ-plane**: Rotation between the \( w \) and \( z \) axes.
4. **XY-plane**: Rotation between the \( x \) and \( y \) axes.
5. **XZ-plane**: Rotation between the \( x \) and \( z \) axes.
6. **YZ-plane**: Rotation between the \( y \) and \( z \) axes.

Each rotation plane involves a rotation around one pair of axes while keeping the other two axes fixed.

### Rotation Matrices in 4D

For a 4D rotation, we can define a 4x4 rotation matrix for each plane, which acts on a 4D vector \( (w, x, y, z) \). Each of these matrices rotates points within its plane while leaving other components unchanged.

For example, the rotation matrix for a rotation in the **WX-plane** by an angle \( \theta \) would be:

\[
R_{WX}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 & 0 \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This matrix rotates the \( w \) and \( x \) coordinates while leaving \( y \) and \( z \) unchanged.

Similarly, for the **XY-plane**:

\[
R_{XY}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\
0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

### Composite Rotations

To perform more complex rotations, you can combine these 4D rotation matrices by multiplying them. For example, a combined rotation in the WX and YZ planes would use the product of \( R_{WX}(\theta_1) \) and \( R_{YZ}(\theta_2) \):

\[
R = R_{WX}(\theta_1) \times R_{YZ}(\theta_2)
\]

### Visualizing 4D Rotations

Since we can’t directly perceive 4D rotations, we visualize them by projecting the 4D object into 3D space. Typically, this involves:
1. **Applying the rotation**: Use the 4D rotation matrix on the tesseract’s vertices.
2. **Projecting to 3D**: Drop one coordinate (e.g., \( w \)) to flatten it to 3D.
3. **Displaying**: Render the 3D projection to observe the rotation effects.

### Key Points of 4D Rotation

- **4D rotations are double-plane rotations**: A 4D object rotates in two planes simultaneously.
- **More freedom of movement**: Objects can rotate in ways impossible in lower dimensions, creating unfamiliar transformations.
- **Visualization challenges**: The effects of 4D rotations are visualized in 3D by projecting the tesseract’s transformed vertices, which often appear as morphing or shifting shapes in 3D.

In 3D projections, 4D rotations often appear as “morphing” shapes, as parts of the tesseract move out of alignment in ways that our 3D intuition may not fully grasp. This unique behavior is characteristic of 4D rotations and adds a fascinating complexity to visualizing 4D objects.
