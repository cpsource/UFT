The expression \(\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}\) represents the **number of unique pairs** of items that can be chosen from \(N\) items. Hereâ€™s why:

### Explanation: Counting Pairs in a Group of \( N \) Items

1. **Choosing Pairs from \( N \) Atoms:**
   - If you have \( N \) atoms and want to count every unique pair of atoms, each pair consists of two distinct atoms selected from the group.
   - For each of the \( N \) atoms, it can pair with \( N - 1 \) other atoms. So, initially, it might seem that there are \( N \times (N - 1) \) possible pairs.

2. **Avoiding Double-Counting:**
   - However, this initial count includes each pair twice (e.g., atom \( A \) paired with atom \( B \) is the same as atom \( B \) paired with atom \( A \)).
   - To count each pair only once, we need to **divide by 2**.

3. **Resulting Formula:**
   - This gives us the number of unique pairs as:
     \[
     \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2}
     \]

### Alternative Explanation: Combinations Formula

This result is also derived from the **combinations formula**, which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from \( N \) items, usually written as \( \binom{N}{2} \):

\[
\binom{N}{2} = \frac{N!}{2!(N - 2)!} = \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2}
\]

So, \(\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}\) gives the number of unique pairs, which is why we use it to calculate the total gravitational potential energy for all pairs in a cluster of \( N \) atoms.
