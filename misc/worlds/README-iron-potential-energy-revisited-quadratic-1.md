If you have two atoms converging on a single central atom, you do not end up with \( N^2 \) times the potential energy of a single pair; rather, the gravitational potential energy would simply be **additive**. Letâ€™s clarify how this works.

### Total Gravitational Potential Energy for \( N \) Atoms

1. **Pairwise Interactions**: The total gravitational potential energy depends on the number of unique **pairwise interactions** between atoms, not on \( N^2 \).

2. **Calculation for \( N \) Atoms Around One Atom**:
   - If you have a central atom and \( N \) other atoms converging on it, each at the same distance \( r \), then each of these \( N \) atoms interacts with the central atom.
   - The potential energy of each of these pairs (central atom and one other atom) is given by:
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} = -\frac{G \cdot m^2}{r}
     \]
   - If you have \( N \) such atoms converging on the central atom, the total potential energy between the central atom and the \( N \) atoms is:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = N \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = N \cdot \left(-\frac{G \cdot m^2}{r}\right) = -\frac{N \cdot G \cdot m^2}{r}
     \]

3. **No \( N^2 \) Factor**: In this configuration, you only get \( N \) times the energy of a single pair, not \( N^2 \), because each atom only interacts gravitationally with the central atom, not with each other.

### When \( N^2 \) (or Quadratic Growth) Might Apply

Quadratic growth in gravitational potential energy (like \( \frac{N(N - 1)}{2} \), which approximates \( \sim N^2 \) for large \( N \)) occurs if **every atom interacts with every other atom** in a fully-connected cluster. In this case:
   - Each pair of atoms contributes potential energy.
   - The total potential energy would then involve \(\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}\) pairs, leading to a more rapid increase in energy as \( N \) grows.

### Summary

For a setup with **two atoms converging on one central atom**, the total gravitational potential energy would be **linear in \( N \)**:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = -\frac{N \cdot G \cdot m^2}{r}
\]
not \( N^2 \). 

Quadratic scaling only applies if each atom in the cluster interacts with every other atom.
