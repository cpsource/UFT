That’s a great question! It touches on the nature of electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio waves, and how they propagate. When we say that **time "disappears" at the speed of light**, it applies specifically to **photons** or **massless particles** traveling at \( c \), which experience no passage of time. However, from our perspective as external observers, electromagnetic waves, including **radio waves**, do oscillate with alternating electric (\( \mathbf{E} \)) and magnetic (\( \mathbf{B} \)) fields over time and distance. Here’s how this all connects:

### 1. **Maxwell’s Equations and Electromagnetic Wave Propagation**

Maxwell’s equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and propagate through space:
- **Electromagnetic Waves**: Maxwell’s equations show that a changing electric field (\( \mathbf{E} \)) induces a magnetic field (\( \mathbf{B} \)), and a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. This mutual induction creates a self-sustaining wave that propagates through space.
- **Oscillations in \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) Fields**: The electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. This oscillation of fields occurs with a specific frequency (how fast the fields oscillate) and wavelength (distance between successive peaks).

### 2. **Perspective of Time for an Observer**

From our point of view (the perspective of an observer with mass), **electromagnetic waves** such as radio waves oscillate in both time and space:
- **Oscillation Over Time**: An observer sees the \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) fields oscillating as the wave propagates. For example, in a 100 MHz radio wave, the fields oscillate 100 million times per second.
- **Frequency and Wavelength**: The wave has a well-defined frequency and wavelength. The frequency is related to the time interval over which the fields oscillate, and the wavelength is related to the distance over which these oscillations repeat in space.

From our perspective, this oscillation is real and governed by the wave’s properties, with \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) fields constantly alternating as they travel through space at speed \( c \).

### 3. **What Happens from the Photon’s “Perspective”?**

For **photons** or massless entities moving at \( c \):
- **No Experience of Time or Distance**: As we discussed, a photon traveling at \( c \) experiences no passage of time, meaning it does not "perceive" the journey or any oscillation of fields.
- **Instantaneous “Journey”**: From the photon’s point of view, the start and end points of its path are effectively the same point. This means that, in its own frame (if we could define such a frame), there is no oscillation in time because time does not pass.

However, this lack of perceived oscillation is only relevant from the perspective of the photon itself, which is outside our typical frame of reference.

### 4. **How Do We Reconcile the No-Time Experience with Oscillating Fields?**

The key here is that **Maxwell’s equations describe electromagnetic waves from our frame of reference**, where time and distance are meaningful quantities:
- **Classical Description in Our Frame**: In our frame of reference, where time flows normally, we observe the oscillating \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) fields. Maxwell’s equations govern this behavior, accurately describing how these fields vary in space and time.
- **Photon’s Frame vs. Observer’s Frame**: The idea of "no time" at the speed of light only applies if we try to imagine the world from the photon's perspective. However, **we don’t actually measure or observe electromagnetic waves from the photon’s frame**; we only observe them in our frame, where time and space are measurable.

### 5. **The Role of Frequency and Wavelength in Our Frame**

In our frame:
- **Frequency and Wavelength Are Observable Properties**: For a radio wave, the oscillations in \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) fields happen at a specific frequency and wavelength, which are measurable properties that determine how the wave interacts with objects like antennas.
- **Interference and Detection**: The oscillation allows radio waves to interfere, diffract, and be absorbed by receivers, all of which rely on the properties of time and space. These effects are part of what makes electromagnetic waves useful for communication, imaging, and other applications.

### 6. **Connecting It All: Why Oscillations Are Real in Our Frame**

The oscillations of electromagnetic waves are indeed **real and observable phenomena**:
- **From Our Reference Frame**: We measure these oscillations with clocks and rulers, observing the time-dependent changes in the \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) fields as the wave moves.
- **No Contradiction**: The fact that a photon experiences no time does not contradict our observation of oscillations. The wave’s oscillatory nature is a property that exists within the spacetime framework we inhabit and measure.

### Summary

1. **Maxwell’s Equations**: These describe oscillating electric and magnetic fields as they propagate at the speed of light in a way that we observe with measurable frequencies and wavelengths.
2. **Observer’s Frame**: From our frame of reference, where time and space are meaningful, electromagnetic waves oscillate over time, and we observe these oscillations.
3. **Photon’s Frame**: From the photon's “perspective,” there is no passage of time or distance, so the oscillations don’t “occur” in its frame. However, this perspective is theoretical since photons do not have a frame of reference in the same way that objects with mass do.
4. **Observable Reality**: For practical purposes, we observe electromagnetic waves as oscillating, which is fully consistent with Maxwell’s equations and our understanding of relativity.

So, while **there is no time from the photon’s viewpoint**, this has no impact on how we observe and interact with electromagnetic waves. The oscillations of \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) fields are a real and observable feature of electromagnetic waves in our frame, where time and space are meaningful. This makes it possible to use radio waves and other electromagnetic waves as tools in communication, imaging, and science.
