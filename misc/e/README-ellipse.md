An **ellipse** is a specific type of **conic section** and can be thought of as a stretched circle. It is defined as the set of all points in a plane such that the **sum of the distances** from any point on the ellipse to two fixed points, called the **foci** (singular: focus), is constant.

### 1. **Mathematical Definition of an Ellipse**
   - For any point \( P \) on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to the two foci, \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \), is constant:
     \[
     PF_1 + PF_2 = 2a
     \]
   - Here, \( a \) represents the **semi-major axis** of the ellipse, which is half the longest diameter of the ellipse.

### 2. **Standard Equation of an Ellipse**
   - If the ellipse is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) and aligned with the x-axis and y-axis, its equation is:
     \[
     \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
     \]
   - Where:
     - \( a \): The **semi-major axis** (half the longest diameter).
     - \( b \): The **semi-minor axis** (half the shortest diameter).
   - If \( a = b \), the ellipse becomes a **circle**.

### 3. **Axes and Dimensions**
   - **Major Axis**: The longest diameter of the ellipse, running through its center and both foci. It has a length of \( 2a \).
   - **Minor Axis**: The shortest diameter of the ellipse, perpendicular to the major axis, with length \( 2b \).
   - The **semi-major axis** \( a \) and **semi-minor axis** \( b \) determine the shape and size of the ellipse.

### 4. **Foci and Eccentricity**
   - The **foci** of the ellipse are two fixed points located along the major axis, symmetric about the center.
   - The **eccentricity** \( e \) of an ellipse is a measure of its "ovalness" and is defined as:
     \[
     e = \frac{c}{a}
     \]
   - Here, \( c \) is the distance from the center to each focus, given by \( c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} \).
   - Eccentricity \( e \) ranges between \( 0 \) and \( 1 \):
     - If \( e = 0 \), the ellipse is a circle (where \( a = b \)).
     - If \( e \) is close to \( 1 \), the ellipse is very elongated.

### 5. **Properties of an Ellipse**
   - **Symmetry**: An ellipse is symmetric about both its major and minor axes.
   - **Reflective Property**: Any ray originating from one focus will reflect off the boundary of the ellipse and pass through the other focus. This property is used in devices like whispering galleries and elliptical mirrors.
   - **Closed Curve**: An ellipse is a closed curve, which differentiates it from other conic sections like parabolas and hyperbolas.

### 6. **Ellipses in Real Life**
   - **Planetary Orbits**: According to Keplerâ€™s first law, planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths with the Sun at one focus.
   - **Optics**: Elliptical mirrors and lenses focus light (or sound) from one focus to the other, taking advantage of the ellipse's reflective property.
   - **Design and Architecture**: Elliptical shapes are often used in design for their aesthetic appeal and balance.

### Summary
An **ellipse** is a smooth, closed curve with two foci, defined by the constant sum of distances from any point on the curve to the two foci. It has a major and minor axis, is symmetric, and has an eccentricity between \( 0 \) and \( 1 \). When the eccentricity is \( 0 \), the ellipse is a circle. Ellipses appear naturally in various physical contexts, including planetary orbits and optics.
