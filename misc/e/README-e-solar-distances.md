Here’s a table of the average distances of the planets in our solar system from the Sun, expressed as the **natural logarithm** of the distance in astronomical units (AU). An **AU** (Astronomical Unit) is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, approximately \( 149.6 \) million kilometers.

To calculate \( \ln(\text{distance in AU}) \), I’ll provide the natural logarithm of each planet’s average distance from the Sun in AU.

| Planet     | Average Distance from Sun (AU) | \( \ln(\text{Distance in AU}) \) |
|------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Mercury    | 0.39                           | -0.94                           |
| Venus      | 0.72                           | -0.33                           |
| Earth      | 1.00                           | 0.00                            |
| Mars       | 1.52                           | 0.42                            |
| Jupiter    | 5.20                           | 1.65                            |
| Saturn     | 9.58                           | 2.26                            |
| Uranus     | 19.22                          | 2.96                            |
| Neptune    | 30.05                          | 3.40                            |

### Explanation

- **Distances in AU**: These values represent each planet's average distance from the Sun in AU.
- **Natural Logarithm** \( \ln(\text{distance}) \): The natural logarithm of each distance (in AU) provides a scaled-down, logarithmic view of planetary distances. This can give insight into how the distances grow in a non-linear way across the solar system, as the planets are much farther apart in the outer solar system.

For example:
- Mercury, at \( 0.39 \) AU, has \( \ln(0.39) \approx -0.94 \).
- Earth, at \( 1.0 \) AU, has \( \ln(1.0) = 0 \).
- Neptune, at \( 30.05 \) AU, has \( \ln(30.05) \approx 3.40 \).

This table shows that distances increase significantly in the outer solar system, as seen in the natural logarithmic scale.
