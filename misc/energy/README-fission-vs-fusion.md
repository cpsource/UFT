Yes, at first glance, it does seem a bit counterintuitive that **energy can be released both by combining small nuclei (fusion) and by breaking apart large nuclei (fission)**. However, this behavior arises naturally from the way **nuclear binding energy** varies with the **size of the nucleus**, and it’s actually a fundamental aspect of nuclear physics.

Here’s an explanation of why this phenomenon occurs and why it makes sense in terms of energy and stability:

### 1. **The Nuclear Binding Energy Curve**
   - The **binding energy per nucleon** (average energy that holds each nucleon in the nucleus) changes as you move across the periodic table from light elements (like hydrogen) to heavy elements (like uranium).
   - **Light nuclei** (like hydrogen and helium) have relatively low binding energy per nucleon.
   - **Heavier nuclei** up to **iron (Fe)** or **nickel (Ni)** have increasingly higher binding energy per nucleon, reaching a maximum around iron-56 or nickel-62.
   - Beyond iron, as nuclei get heavier (such as lead or uranium), the binding energy per nucleon starts to decrease again.

This trend in binding energy per nucleon creates two "energy-release regions" on either side of iron/nickel, leading to **fusion** for light elements and **fission** for heavy elements.

### 2. **Fusion: Energy from Combining Small Nuclei**
   - **Fusion** occurs when **small nuclei combine** to form a larger nucleus. For example, **hydrogen nuclei** (protons) can fuse to form **helium** in stars.
   - In small nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon is relatively low, so by **fusing** them together into a larger nucleus, they move to a higher binding energy per nucleon state.
   - The **difference in binding energy** between the starting nuclei and the fused nucleus is released as energy. This is why fusion of light elements releases energy — the resulting nucleus has a higher binding energy per nucleon, making it more stable.
   - Fusion is the process that powers stars and provides the massive amounts of energy seen in hydrogen bombs.

### 3. **Fission: Energy from Splitting Large Nuclei**
   - **Fission** occurs when a **large, heavy nucleus splits** into two or more smaller nuclei. For example, **uranium-235** can split into lighter elements like barium and krypton.
   - In heavy nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon is relatively low compared to medium-sized nuclei (like iron and nickel).
   - When a heavy nucleus splits, the resulting smaller nuclei are closer to the peak binding energy (around iron), meaning they have **higher binding energy per nucleon** than the original heavy nucleus.
   - The **difference in binding energy** is released as energy. This is why fission of heavy elements releases energy — the resulting smaller nuclei have a higher binding energy per nucleon, making them more stable.
   - This principle underlies nuclear reactors and atomic bombs, where splitting heavy nuclei like uranium and plutonium releases vast amounts of energy.

### 4. **Why It Makes Sense Physically**
   - The behavior of the **binding energy curve** is due to the balance between two forces within the nucleus:
     - The **strong nuclear force**: This force is attractive and binds nucleons (protons and neutrons) together, but it acts only over very short distances (about 1 femtometer).
     - The **electromagnetic force**: This force is repulsive between protons (since they have the same positive charge) and acts over longer distances than the strong nuclear force.
   - In **small nuclei**, the strong nuclear force effectively pulls nucleons together, and as they combine, they reach higher binding energies, making them more stable.
   - In **very large nuclei**, the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons starts to outweigh the attractive strong nuclear force over the larger nuclear volume. This makes very large nuclei less stable and susceptible to fission, where splitting them into smaller, more tightly bound nuclei releases energy.

### 5. **Fusion and Fission: Two Ways of Seeking Stability**
   - **Fusion** brings small nuclei together to increase their stability (moving them up the binding energy curve toward iron).
   - **Fission** breaks apart large nuclei to increase stability (moving them down the binding energy curve toward iron).
   - Both processes release energy because they move nuclei **closer to the peak stability** around iron and nickel.

### Summary
- The reason energy is released in both fusion and fission is because of the **binding energy per nucleon curve**, which peaks around iron and nickel.
- **Fusion** of light nuclei and **fission** of heavy nuclei both move toward this peak, resulting in more stable nuclei and releasing energy in the process.
- This seemingly paradoxical behavior makes sense when you consider that the goal of both fusion and fission is to reach a **more stable, higher-binding-energy state**.

So, while it may seem strange, this dual release of energy is a fundamental outcome of how nuclear forces work, driving the processes that power both stars and nuclear reactors.
