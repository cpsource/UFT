It seems like you might be referring to **neutrinos** rather than "neutronios." Neutrinos are fundamental particles in physics, distinct from neutrons. Here’s an overview:

### What is a Neutrino?
A **neutrino** is an extremely light, neutral (uncharged) subatomic particle. Neutrinos are part of the **lepton family** of fundamental particles in the **Standard Model of particle physics** and are known for their weak interactions with other matter, making them very difficult to detect.

### Key Properties of Neutrinos:
1. **Very Small Mass**:
   - Neutrinos have an incredibly tiny mass, much smaller than electrons. While their mass is not exactly zero, it is so small that it's hard to measure, and scientists continue to work on determining the exact mass.
   
2. **Neutral Charge**:
   - Neutrinos carry **no electric charge**, so they are unaffected by electromagnetic forces. This neutrality is one reason they interact very weakly with matter.

3. **Types (Flavors) of Neutrinos**:
   - There are three types, or "flavors," of neutrinos associated with their respective particles:
     - **Electron neutrino (νₑ)**: associated with electrons.
     - **Muon neutrino (ν_μ)**: associated with muons.
     - **Tau neutrino (ν_τ)**: associated with tau particles.
   - Neutrinos can oscillate, meaning they can change from one flavor to another as they travel through space.

4. **Weak Interaction**:
   - Neutrinos interact only via the **weak nuclear force** (one of the four fundamental forces) and **gravity**. They do not interact via the electromagnetic force or the strong nuclear force.
   - This weak interaction allows neutrinos to pass through most matter virtually undisturbed. Billions of neutrinos pass through our bodies every second without interacting with atoms in any noticeable way.

### How Neutrinos Are Produced:
Neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions, including:
- **Nuclear Fusion in Stars**: The Sun and other stars produce neutrinos during nuclear fusion reactions, where hydrogen atoms are fused to form helium.
- **Nuclear Decay**: Radioactive decay processes, such as **beta decay**, produce neutrinos.
- **Supernova Explosions**: In a supernova, a massive burst of neutrinos is released as the star collapses.
- **Artificial Sources**: Nuclear reactors and particle accelerators on Earth also produce neutrinos.

### Why Neutrinos Are Important
- **Astrophysics**: Neutrinos provide information about processes happening inside stars, supernovae, and other cosmic events because they escape dense environments and travel through space largely unaffected.
- **Fundamental Physics**: Studying neutrinos helps scientists understand fundamental particle interactions and properties, as well as the nature of mass and the universe's structure.
- **Neutrino Oscillations**: The discovery of neutrino oscillations, where neutrinos change flavors, has implications for our understanding of particle physics and suggests that neutrinos have mass (since massless particles cannot oscillate).

### Summary
A **neutrino** is a nearly massless, neutral subatomic particle that interacts weakly with matter. There are three types of neutrinos (electron, muon, and tau), and they are produced in nuclear reactions such as those occurring in the Sun, during radioactive decay, and in supernova explosions. Neutrinos are valuable in studying the universe and understanding fundamental physics due to their unique properties and weak interactions with other matter.
