When a **star goes supernova**, an enormous amount of energy is released, resulting in one of the most powerful explosions in the universe. This energy comes from a combination of **gravitational collapse**, **nuclear fusion**, and **neutrino emissions** during the final stages of the star's life. Let’s break down the process and see where the energy originates:

### 1. **Core Collapse of Massive Stars**
   - For massive stars (typically those with more than about **8 times the mass of the Sun**), nuclear fusion proceeds through successive stages: hydrogen to helium, helium to carbon, and eventually to heavier elements like oxygen, neon, silicon, and ultimately **iron** in the core.
   - **Iron cannot undergo fusion to release energy** because iron-56 is at the peak of the binding energy curve. Fusing iron requires energy instead of releasing it.
   - When the core of a massive star reaches this **iron stage**, it can no longer produce energy through fusion to counteract **gravity**. The star’s internal pressure can no longer support its weight, and the **core collapses** under gravity.

### 2. **Gravitational Potential Energy**
   - As the core collapses, **gravitational potential energy** is converted into kinetic energy, heating up the core to incredibly high temperatures (billions of degrees).
   - This **gravitational energy** is released as the core shrinks dramatically, compressing down to a tiny fraction of its original size in just a fraction of a second.
   - For a star with a core around 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (the Chandrasekhar limit), the collapse is so extreme that protons and electrons combine to form neutrons, creating a **neutron star** (or, if massive enough, it can continue collapsing to form a black hole).

### 3. **Neutrino Burst**
   - During the collapse, when protons and electrons combine to form neutrons, they release a massive amount of **neutrinos** via a process called **neutronization**:
     \[
     p^+ + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e
     \]
   - This process produces an enormous number of **neutrinos** (subatomic particles that interact very weakly with matter) that carry away a significant portion of the core’s energy.
   - In fact, about **99% of the energy** from a supernova explosion is carried away by neutrinos, with only a small fraction being radiated as visible light, gamma rays, and kinetic energy.
   - Although neutrinos rarely interact with matter, the sheer number of them in a supernova explosion is so large that they transfer a tiny fraction of their energy to the outer layers of the star, helping drive the explosion.

### 4. **Shock Wave Formation and Explosion**
   - As the core collapses and forms a neutron star, it creates an intense **shock wave** that propagates outward.
   - This shock wave initially stalls due to the immense pressure from the infalling material, but it is **revitalized** by energy from the neutrinos escaping the core and from intense heating as the shock wave rebounds off the dense core.
   - When the shock wave regains energy, it blows through the outer layers of the star, creating the supernova explosion.

### 5. **Nucleosynthesis and Energy Release**
   - In the supernova explosion, temperatures are so high that new elements are forged in a process called **supernova nucleosynthesis**. This process produces heavy elements (such as gold, uranium, and other elements beyond iron) that cannot be formed through ordinary stellar fusion.
   - The formation of these new elements also releases energy, contributing to the explosion.

### Summary of Energy Sources in a Supernova:
1. **Gravitational Collapse**: The gravitational potential energy released when the core collapses drives much of the energy release in a supernova.
2. **Neutrino Emission**: Neutrinos carry away about 99% of the core’s energy, with a fraction of this energy helping to blow apart the outer layers.
3. **Shock Wave**: The shock wave, initially generated by the core collapse and boosted by neutrino energy, propels the outer layers outward.
4. **Nucleosynthesis**: The fusion of heavy elements in the outer layers during the explosion also releases energy.

### Summary
The energy in a supernova explosion primarily comes from the **gravitational collapse of the core** of a massive star, which generates extreme temperatures and pressures, leading to intense neutrino emissions and a powerful shock wave. Together, these forces combine to blow apart the outer layers of the star, creating a spectacular explosion that can briefly outshine entire galaxies and disperses heavy elements into space. This explosion contributes to the formation of new stars and planets, seeding the universe with elements necessary for life.
