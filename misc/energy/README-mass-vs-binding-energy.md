Yes, **nuclear binding energy** is indeed a function of mass. The relationship between **mass** and **binding energy** in atomic nuclei is one of the foundational concepts of nuclear physics. Here’s how it works:

### 1. **Mass-Energy Equivalence** (Einstein's \(E = mc^2\))
   - The concept of nuclear binding energy is directly linked to **Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence** principle, which states that mass and energy are interchangeable:
     \[
     E = mc^2
     \]
   - When nucleons (protons and neutrons) come together to form a nucleus, some of their combined mass is converted into binding energy. This binding energy is what holds the nucleus together.

### 2. **Mass Defect**
   - The **mass of a nucleus** is always **less than the sum of the masses of the individual protons and neutrons** that make it up.
   - This difference in mass is called the **mass defect** and is a measure of the binding energy of the nucleus. The mass defect (\( \Delta m \)) can be converted to binding energy (\(E\)) using the formula:
     \[
     E = \Delta m \cdot c^2
     \]
   - For example, in the helium-4 nucleus, the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the total mass of two protons and two neutrons. This "missing" mass represents the binding energy that was released when the nucleus was formed.

### 3. **Binding Energy per Nucleon and Stability**
   - The **binding energy per nucleon** (average binding energy per proton or neutron) is an important indicator of nuclear stability. Nuclei with higher binding energy per nucleon are generally more stable.
   - The **binding energy per nucleon** typically increases with atomic number, reaches a peak around **iron-56 (⁵⁶Fe)**, and then gradually decreases for heavier elements. This is why **iron and nickel** are among the most stable elements, with the highest binding energy per nucleon.

### 4. **Heavier Nuclei and Fission, Lighter Nuclei and Fusion**
   - For **heavy nuclei** (like uranium-235 or plutonium-239), the binding energy per nucleon is lower, meaning they are less stable. When these heavy nuclei undergo **fission** (splitting into smaller nuclei), the resulting fragments have a higher binding energy per nucleon, and the difference in binding energy is released as energy.
   - For **light nuclei** (like hydrogen and helium), **fusion** can release energy by combining them into a larger nucleus with a higher binding energy per nucleon. This is why fusion powers stars, where hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium, releasing significant energy.

### Summary
- **Nuclear binding energy is a function of mass** because the formation of a nucleus involves a conversion of mass into energy (the mass defect).
- The **mass defect** corresponds to the **binding energy** that holds the nucleus together.
- The **binding energy per nucleon** varies across the periodic table, peaking at iron and nickel, which are the most stable nuclei.
  
In essence, the mass and nuclear binding energy are deeply intertwined, with the mass defect directly representing the energy that binds nucleons together in the nucleus.
