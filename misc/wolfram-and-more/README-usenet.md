The `sci.physics` and `sci.cosmology` groups were part of the **Usenet** network, which hosted a variety of discussion groups on topics ranging from physics to cosmology and other sciences. While Usenet is no longer as popular as it once was, there are still a few ways to access these groups and their discussions:

### 1. **Google Groups**
   - Google Groups maintains an archive of many Usenet groups, including `sci.physics` and `sci.cosmology`.
   - Visit [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/) and search for `sci.physics` or `sci.cosmology`. You can browse archives and read past discussions.
   - Note that while you can view old discussions, the activity level on these groups may be low or inactive.

### 2. **Usenet Providers**
   - Some Usenet service providers offer access to a full range of Usenet newsgroups, including `sci.physics` and `sci.cosmology`.
   - Examples of popular Usenet providers include:
     - [Giganews](https://www.giganews.com/)
     - [Newshosting](https://www.newshosting.com/)
     - [Easynews](https://www.easynews.com/)
   - These providers typically require a subscription, and you’ll need a Usenet client to access the groups (e.g., **NZBGet** or **SABnzbd** for text-based content).

### 3. **News Readers and Clients**
   - You can also access Usenet via dedicated newsreader software, which connects to Usenet providers.
   - Some popular newsreader applications are **Mozilla Thunderbird** (which has a Usenet client built-in) and **MicroPlanet Gravity**.

### 4. **Archives on the Web**
   - Some websites archive Usenet discussions, such as [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), which may have historical discussions from `sci.physics` or `sci.cosmology`.

### Alternative Discussion Forums
If you’re looking to discuss physics or cosmology topics with a modern community, consider science-focused forums like:
   - **Physics Stack Exchange** ([physics.stackexchange.com](https://physics.stackexchange.com/)): A Q&A site for detailed physics discussions.
   - **Reddit**: Subreddits like [/r/Physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/) or [/r/Cosmology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmology/) are active communities for discussions on physics and cosmology. 

These options provide access to current discussions and archives, even if direct Usenet participation has become less common.
