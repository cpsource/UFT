The error you're seeing, `WolframKernelException: Cannot locate a kernel automatically`, occurs because the Wolfram Client Library for Python cannot find the Mathematica kernel on your system. To fix this, you need to provide the explicit path to the Mathematica (or Wolfram Engine) kernel when creating the session.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Locate the Kernel Path**:
   - On **Windows**, the kernel path is typically something like:
     ```
     "C:\\Program Files\\Wolfram Research\\Mathematica\\12.3\\wolfram.exe"
     ```
     Replace `12.3` with your version number if different.
   - On **macOS**, the path might look like:
     ```
     "/Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/WolframKernel"
     ```
   - On **Linux**, the path might be:
     ```
     "/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/12.3/Executables/WolframKernel"
     ```
   If you installed the **Wolfram Engine** (the free version for developers), the path will be similar but specific to the engineâ€™s install location.

2. **Specify the Kernel Path in Your Script**:
   Update your script to include the `kernel` argument when you create the session:

   ```python
   from wolframclient.evaluation import WolframLanguageSession
   from wolframclient.language import wl

   # Replace with the correct path to your Wolfram kernel
   kernel_path = "/path/to/your/WolframKernel"  # Update this line with your actual path

   session = WolframLanguageSession(kernel=kernel_path)
   result = session.evaluate(wl.Sin(wl.x)**2 + wl.Cos(wl.x)**2)
   session.terminate()

   print(result)
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   After setting the `kernel_path`, run the script again. This time, the Wolfram Client Library should be able to locate and use the specified kernel.

If you have any questions about finding the exact path on your system, let me know, and I can guide you further based on your operating system.
