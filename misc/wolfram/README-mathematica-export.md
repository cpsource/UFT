Yes, in **Mathematica (Wolfram Language)**, you can export or generate code in C or Python, though with some limitations depending on the complexity of your Mathematica code. Here are some methods to accomplish this:

### 1. **Exporting Simple Expressions to C Code**

If you have a mathematical expression or function, you can export it as C code:

```mathematica
expr = Sin[x]^2 + Cos[x]^2;
Export["expression.c", CForm[expr]]
```

This will save a `.c` file with the expression written in C-like syntax. However, it’s limited to straightforward mathematical functions and does not convert full Mathematica programs with complex structures (like loops or pattern matching) to C.

For functions, you can use `FunctionCompile` to make them ready for C code generation, as long as they are simple and compatible with this approach.

### 2. **Using `CCodeGenerate` Package**

Mathematica also has a **CCodeGenerate** package for more complex expressions and functions. You can load it and use it to generate C code:

```mathematica
<< CCodeGenerator`
CCodeStringGenerate[Sin[x]^2 + Cos[x]^2, "functionName"]
```

This provides a string of C code, which you can then save to a file. It’s more powerful than `CForm` but still has limitations for complex scripts.

### 3. **Exporting to Python Code**

There isn’t a direct way to export to Python code, but you can generate Python-like expressions with string manipulation. For example:

```mathematica
expr = Sin[x]^2 + Cos[x]^2;
Export["expression.py", ToString[expr, InputForm]]
```

This will create a `.py` file with a Python-compatible string representation of the expression. However, for full Mathematica programs, you would need to manually convert the code to Python or use a symbolic library in Python (like SymPy) to handle symbolic expressions similar to Mathematica.

### 4. **WolframScript and External Evaluation**

For integrating Mathematica with Python directly, **WolframScript** or **ExternalEvaluate** can allow you to run Mathematica code within a Python environment, providing an alternative approach to exporting. 

For instance, with Wolfram Client Library for Python, you can execute Mathematica code directly in Python and get the results back, though this requires a Mathematica kernel to be available:

```python
from wolframclient.evaluation import WolframLanguageSession
from wolframclient.language import wl

session = WolframLanguageSession()
result = session.evaluate(wl.Sin(wl.x)**2 + wl.Cos(wl.x)**2)
session.terminate()
```

This way, you can keep the computation in Mathematica and integrate it with Python workflows.
