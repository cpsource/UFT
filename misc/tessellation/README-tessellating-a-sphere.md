Tessellating a **sphere** is more complex than tessellating a flat plane due to its curvature. The types of shapes that can tessellate a sphere are limited and are known as **spherical polyhedra**. These shapes can be classified into regular and semi-regular polyhedra, as well as other special tessellations. Here are the main types of shapes and tiling patterns that can tessellate spheres:

### 1. **Platonic Solids**
- **Definition**: Platonic solids are the most symmetrical polyhedra, where each face is the same regular polygon and the same number of faces meet at each vertex.
- **Examples of Sphere Tessellations**:
  - **Tetrahedron**: Composed of 4 equilateral triangles. When mapped onto a sphere, the sphere is divided into 4 triangular regions.
  - **Cube**: Composed of 6 square faces. When projected onto a sphere, the sphere is divided into 6 quadrilateral regions.
  - **Octahedron**: Composed of 8 equilateral triangles. This can be tessellated on a sphere with 8 triangular regions.
  - **Dodecahedron**: Composed of 12 regular pentagons. When tessellated onto a sphere, it forms 12 pentagonal regions.
  - **Icosahedron**: Composed of 20 equilateral triangles, forming 20 triangular regions on a sphere.

### 2. **Archimedean Solids**
- **Definition**: Archimedean solids are polyhedra with faces that are regular polygons of more than one type, but the same arrangement of polygons meets at each vertex.
- **Examples of Sphere Tessellations**:
  - **Truncated Icosahedron**: This is the shape of a soccer ball, with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. It can tessellate a sphere and is also seen in the structure of a buckyball.
  - **Truncated Dodecahedron**: Composed of 12 decagons and 20 triangles.
  - **Snub Polyhedra**: Includes shapes like the **snub dodecahedron**, which has a combination of triangles and pentagons.

### 3. **Geodesic Domes**
- **Definition**: Geodesic domes are structures made from a network of triangles that approximate a sphere. They are derived from the **icosahedron** by subdividing each of its triangular faces into smaller triangles.
- **Properties**:
  - Geodesic domes create a tessellation of a sphere using triangular panels that provide strength and stability.
  - They are common in architectural and engineering applications due to their efficient distribution of stress.

### 4. **Goldberg Polyhedra**
- **Definition**: Goldberg polyhedra are tessellations of a sphere using hexagons and pentagons. They generalize the structure of the truncated icosahedron (e.g., the soccer ball).
- **Properties**:
  - The arrangement follows a pattern similar to that of geodesic domes, where hexagons are arranged with occasional pentagons to close the structure.
  - The pattern ensures that the total curvature is spread evenly, allowing the structure to approximate a sphere.

### 5. **Spherical Tilings with Mixed Polygons**
- **Definition**: Some tessellations use combinations of polygons that meet at vertices in non-regular arrangements.
- **Examples**:
  - Tessellations using **triangles and quadrilaterals**.
  - Patterns where different polygons (such as pentagons and hexagons) are used in a repeating pattern, often inspired by nature (e.g., turtle shells or certain viruses).

### 6. **Non-Periodic Tessellations**
- **Definition**: Tessellations that do not have a repeating pattern across the surface.
- **Examples**:
  - **Aperiodic tiling** like **Penrose tiling** can be mapped onto a sphere in a way that does not repeat but still covers the surface completely.
  - These patterns are more complex and typically require computational methods to design and implement.

### 7. **Nature-Inspired Tessellations**
- **Examples**:
  - **Fullerenes (Buckyballs)**: These are carbon molecules structured similarly to the truncated icosahedron, with hexagons and pentagons forming a spherical shape.
  - **Biological Structures**: Certain viruses and microscopic organisms have protein shells that resemble spherical tilings made of hexagons and pentagons.

### Special Considerations

- **Euler’s Polyhedron Formula**: For any convex polyhedron (including spherical tessellations), Euler’s formula applies:
  \[
  V - E + F = 2
  \]
  where:
  - \( V \) is the number of vertices,
  - \( E \) is the number of edges,
  - \( F \) is the number of faces.
- **Uniformity and Symmetry**: Some tessellations strive for uniformity and symmetry (e.g., Platonic and Archimedean solids), while others may be irregular or mixed.

### Summary

Tessellating a sphere can be achieved using various geometric shapes and structures, such as:
- **Platonic solids** (triangles, squares, pentagons),
- **Archimedean solids** (e.g., truncated icosahedron),
- **Geodesic domes** (triangular panels),
- **Goldberg polyhedra** (hexagons and pentagons),
- **Nature-inspired structures** like fullerenes.

These tessellations can be regular, semi-regular, or aperiodic and are used in diverse fields ranging from architecture to chemistry and biology.
