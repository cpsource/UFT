The study of how many tiles can fit on shapes is known as **tessellation** or **tiling theory**. This branch of mathematics explores how shapes can be arranged to completely cover a surface without overlaps or gaps. Tessellation theory can involve regular, semi-regular, or irregular tiling patterns and has applications in various fields, including geometry, art, and computational mathematics.

### Key Concepts in Tessellation or Tiling Theory

1. **Tessellation**:
   - A **tessellation** is a pattern of shapes that fit together perfectly to cover a plane. The shapes, called **tiles**, are often polygons but can be any shape that can repeat without leaving gaps.
   - Example: Regular tiling with squares, equilateral triangles, or hexagons.

2. **Tiling Theory**:
   - **Tiling theory** is the mathematical study of how to cover a plane using a set of shapes according to specific rules. It investigates which shapes or sets of shapes can be used to tile a surface and how many ways they can do so.
   - Mathematicians look at different properties of tiling, such as periodicity (repeating patterns) and aperiodicity (non-repeating patterns).

3. **Regular and Semi-Regular Tessellations**:
   - **Regular tessellations** use only one type of regular polygon (e.g., all squares or all equilateral triangles) to cover the plane.
   - **Semi-regular tessellations** use two or more types of regular polygons arranged in a repeating pattern.
   - Example: A tessellation that alternates between squares and octagons.

4. **Aperiodic Tiling**:
   - **Aperiodic tiling** is a type of tiling that covers a plane without a repeating pattern. One famous example of aperiodic tiling is the **Penrose tiling**, which uses a set of shapes that tile the plane in a non-repeating pattern.
   - Aperiodic tiling is significant in the study of quasicrystals and other natural structures.

5. **Tiling in Higher Dimensions**:
   - Tiling theory is not limited to 2D planes; it can also extend to 3D and higher-dimensional spaces. Mathematicians explore how polyhedra (3D shapes) can fit together to fill a space.

6. **Packing Problems**:
   - Closely related to tiling theory is the study of **packing problems**, which involve finding the most efficient way to fit shapes within a given boundary, such as packing circles or spheres in a box. This is commonly studied in the field of **discrete geometry**.

### Applications of Tessellation and Tiling Theory

- **Architecture and Design**: Tiling patterns are used to create aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound designs in floors, walls, and buildings.
- **Computer Graphics**: Tiling algorithms help create textures and patterns in video games, simulations, and animations.
- **Mathematical Puzzles**: Many mathematical puzzles and recreational math problems involve tiling or covering surfaces with specific shapes.
- **Physics and Chemistry**: The study of quasicrystals and other materials with non-repeating structures draws on concepts from aperiodic tiling.
- **Art**: Artists such as **M.C. Escher** used tessellation principles to create intricate, interlocking patterns in their works.

### Related Fields

- **Combinatorial Geometry**: This field involves studying the combinatorial properties and arrangements of geometric objects, including tiling and covering problems.
- **Discrete Mathematics**: Tiling theory often involves discrete mathematics, as it looks at finite sets of shapes and arrangements.
- **Topology**: Some aspects of tiling theory overlap with topology, especially when studying tilings on different surfaces, such as spheres or tori.

### Famous Problems and Theorems

- **Kepler Conjecture**: A theorem related to the packing of spheres, stating that the densest arrangement of spheres in three dimensions is the face-centered cubic packing.
- **Domino Tiling Problem**: A problem involving covering a region (often a chessboard-like grid) using dominos or other shapes.
- **Penrose Tiling**: Discovered by mathematician **Roger Penrose**, this is a set of aperiodic tiles that can cover a plane without repeating.

### Summary

The study of how tiles can fit onto different shapes or cover surfaces is known as **tessellation** or **tiling theory**. It combines concepts from geometry, discrete mathematics, and combinatorial mathematics and has applications in art, architecture, computer science, and natural sciences.
