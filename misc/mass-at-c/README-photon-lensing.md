Yes, photons are indeed subject to **gravitational lensing**, which might seem confusing since they are **massless** and should, intuitively, not be affected by gravity in the way massive objects are. However, gravitational lensing of photons (and other particles) can be fully explained by **Einstein’s theory of General Relativity**. Let’s break down how and why this happens:

### 1. **Photons and Gravity: Gravitational Lensing Explained by Spacetime Curvature**
   - According to **General Relativity**, gravity is not a force that pulls on objects directly (as Newtonian gravity suggests). Instead, gravity is the result of **curvature in spacetime** caused by the presence of mass and energy.
   - Massive objects, like stars or galaxies, curve the spacetime around them. This curvature affects the path of anything moving through that region of space, including massless particles like photons.

### 2. **Why Photons Are Affected by Curved Spacetime**
   - Since photons travel at the speed of light, they follow what are called **null geodesics** — the “straightest” possible paths in curved spacetime.
   - When photons pass near a massive object, the spacetime around the object is curved, and photons follow this curvature. This results in the bending of their trajectory, which we observe as **gravitational lensing**.
   - Importantly, this effect is **not due to a direct gravitational pull** on the photon (since they have no mass) but rather due to the photon following the “curved path” of spacetime.

### 3. **Gravitational Lensing Is Not a Function of Photon Mass**
   - The bending of light, or gravitational lensing, does not depend on photons having mass. Instead, it’s entirely a result of the curvature of spacetime.
   - This is why both massless photons and massive particles experience gravitational lensing. In both cases, they are simply following the curved paths dictated by the shape of spacetime.

### 4. **Energy and Momentum in Curved Spacetime**
   - Even though photons are massless, they have **energy** and **momentum**. According to relativity, both energy and momentum contribute to how objects move through spacetime.
   - This means that photons, with their energy and momentum, are still influenced by the curvature of spacetime, leading to effects like gravitational lensing.

### Why Gravitational Lensing Happens Even for Massless Particles

To summarize:
   - Gravitational lensing occurs because spacetime itself is curved by mass and energy, and all particles (massive or massless) follow paths in this curved spacetime.
   - This bending is a purely geometric effect and does not require particles to have mass; it only requires that they travel through curved spacetime.
   - This understanding aligns with General Relativity, where the geometry of spacetime dictates the paths of all particles, regardless of their mass.

So, gravitational lensing **is a function of gravity** but not in the sense of a “force” acting on mass. Instead, it’s the **effect of spacetime curvature** on the paths of particles, which is why even massless photons are subject to it.
