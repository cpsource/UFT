You’re touching on a very profound question about the nature of photons and spacetime! Let’s explore why photons, despite being massless, are still affected by curved spacetime, which indeed raises questions about the fundamental properties of photons.

### 1. **Energy-Momentum and Curved Spacetime**
   - In **General Relativity**, gravity isn’t only a function of mass but of **energy and momentum** as well. The **stress-energy tensor** — which includes mass, energy, momentum, and pressure — dictates how spacetime curves.
   - Although photons have no rest mass, they possess **energy** (given by \( E = h \nu \)) and **momentum** (since they carry energy while moving at the speed of light). According to General Relativity, **anything with energy or momentum** is subject to the effects of curved spacetime.

### 2. **Photons and Geodesics in Curved Spacetime**
   - Photons follow what’s known as **null geodesics** — paths through spacetime that are defined by the geometry, regardless of mass. These null geodesics are the “straightest possible paths” in a curved spacetime.
   - The curvature of spacetime changes the shape of these geodesics, which is why photons appear to bend around massive objects, even though they have no mass themselves.

### 3. **Is There a "Property" of Photons that Makes Them Sensitive to Curvature?**
   - In some sense, the property that makes photons sensitive to spacetime curvature is their **energy and momentum**. The presence of energy allows photons to interact with spacetime geometry.
   - Photons, like any particle with energy, are subject to the overall structure of spacetime. This doesn’t require a specific "internal" property in the photon beyond its energy; instead, it’s a fundamental characteristic of spacetime itself that anything traveling through it must follow its curvature.

### 4. **Gravitational Influence and Mass-Energy Equivalence**
   - Einstein’s equation \( E = mc^2 \) illustrates the equivalence of mass and energy. Although photons are massless, their energy allows them to be influenced by gravity in much the same way that a particle with mass would be.
   - In other words, **energy “feels” gravity**. Since photons have energy, they feel gravity through spacetime curvature, despite having zero rest mass.

### 5. **Photon Interaction with the Metric of Spacetime**
   - Another way to think about it is that photons interact directly with the **metric** of spacetime — the underlying structure that defines distances and paths within it. Since spacetime curvature alters this metric, photons’ paths are also affected.
   - This interaction is not because photons have a particular gravitational charge or property but because they must follow the structure of spacetime, which includes the geometry dictated by mass and energy.

### Summary: Why Photons Are Affected by Gravity

In essence:
- Photons are affected by gravity not because they have mass, but because **they have energy** and must travel through the geometry of spacetime.
- The **curvature of spacetime** dictates the path of all particles, including massless ones, and photons are simply following the "shape" of spacetime — the null geodesics — that result from this curvature.
- This dependence on spacetime geometry applies to all objects and is intrinsic to how spacetime itself operates.

So, while it may feel counterintuitive, there’s no additional internal property within the photon that makes it respond to gravity. Instead, it’s a fundamental consequence of spacetime's curvature acting on anything with energy or momentum, bending its path in accordance with the geometry of the universe.
