Neutrinos are **almost never at rest** due to their unique properties and the way they interact with other particles:

1. **Extremely Low Mass**:
   - Neutrinos have very tiny masses, estimated to be less than 0.1 eV. Because of this, even tiny amounts of energy can impart high speeds to neutrinos, often close to the speed of light.
   - For a particle with such a small mass, even low-energy environments give it enough kinetic energy to remain highly mobile.

2. **Cosmic Neutrino Background (CÎ½B)**:
   - The cosmic neutrino background, relic neutrinos from the Big Bang, are the lowest-energy neutrinos known. These neutrinos have been "cooled" by the expansion of the universe and thus have extremely low energy.
   - Even these neutrinos are not technically at rest. They are estimated to move at speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second due to their tiny residual energy from the early universe, although this is very slow compared to the speeds of higher-energy neutrinos.

3. **Solar and High-Energy Neutrinos**:
   - Neutrinos from the Sun, cosmic rays, supernovae, and other high-energy processes are produced with high kinetic energies. They travel close to the speed of light and are never at rest, as they carry substantial momentum.

4. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:
   - The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also plays a role. A neutrino's tiny mass and its constant state of motion make it very challenging to "trap" or observe at rest, as any attempt to localize a neutrino with precision would impart additional uncertainty in its momentum.
   - This principle implies that even in theoretical low-energy states, neutrinos would still possess some residual motion.

### Summary
In practical terms, neutrinos are never truly at rest. Even the lowest-energy relic neutrinos from the Big Bang continue to move, albeit slowly, due to their tiny mass and the residual kinetic energy they retain from the early universe. All other neutrinos, such as those from astrophysical processes, travel at extremely high speeds, close to the speed of light.
