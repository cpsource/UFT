# Unified Field Theory (UFT)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Unified Field Theory (UFT)** repository! This project presents a new approach to unifying fundamental forces and particles, exploring concepts in physics from inertia to dark matter and gravitational effects. By rethinking how wave functions contribute to mass, inertia, and gravitational fields, this theory attempts to provide fresh insights into the fundamental workings of our universe.

This work is a culmination of hypotheses and theoretical frameworks developed to explore the properties of matter, energy, and spacetime. 

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Wave Functions and Inertia**
   - **Hypothesis**: Inertia arises from wave functions emitted by mass, propagating outward at the speed of light (c). When a mass accelerates, the new wave emitted interacts with existing waves, causing resistance to motion. This hypothesis reframes inertia as a natural consequence of wave interaction, challenging traditional views on mass and motion.
   - **Application**: This framework could redefine how we understand force, acceleration, and momentum at both macroscopic and quantum scales.

### 2. **Gravity and Gravitational Waves**
   - **Hypothesis**: Gravity is described as a field emitted by wave functions of mass. The interactions of these wave fields create gravitational effects that align with observations of spacetime warping and black hole phenomena.
   - **Exploration**: This approach allows for a continuous gravitational field even at the quantum level, suggesting a more unified view of mass and gravitational attraction.

### 3. **Dark Matter as Transient Wave Structures**
   - **Hypothesis**: Dark matter may consist of unstable wave functions or "proto-particles" that nearly form stable structures but decay quickly. These quasi-stable fields collectively create gravitational effects without interacting with light.
   - **Implications**: By modeling dark matter as transient wave structures, this theory offers a new perspective on the elusive nature of dark matter and its gravitational impact on the cosmos.

### 4. **Relativistic Time Dilation and Wave Compression**
   - **Hypothesis**: Time dilation with speed could emerge from the interaction and compression of wave functions at high velocities. As objects accelerate, the wave function’s oscillations slow, resulting in time dilation observed at relativistic speeds.
   - **Explanation**: This hypothesis reinterprets time as a function of wave interactions rather than a fixed component of spacetime, offering insights into time dilation as a wave-based phenomenon.

### 5. **Matter and Temperature at Quantum Scales**
   - **Concept**: Matter can be viewed as a “locus of oscillation” within a wave cell. At near-zero temperatures, the wave cell spreads, failing to localize the wave structure, which may explain the behavior of matter as it approaches absolute zero.

## Current Progress and Goals

This repository includes:
- **Hypothetical Frameworks**: Descriptions of wave-based models for inertia, gravity, and dark matter.
- **Mathematical and Computational Models**: Ongoing development of equations and simulations to test these theories.
- **Supporting Research**: Files and notes on alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics, relativistic physics, and cosmology.

## The Unified Field Theory (UFT) Framework

Current theories discuss free space. More detail here: [README-properties-of-free-space.md](https://t2m.io/pw6z7c7)

Fundamentally, this **Unified Field Theory (UFT)** proposes that every entity radiates a field outward at the speed of light, **c**. This framework will use the concept of this outward-radiating field to derive various effects that, today, are considered fundamental properties of matter.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these effects in turn and demonstrate how they can be explained through the principles of **UFT**.

To dive into this project, step to each section in turn, as following concepts will build on preceeding ones.

### Inertia

In classical thinking, inertia is defined as the resistance of a mass (a property) to a change in velosity. More detail here: [README-define-inertia.md](https://t2m.io/RWx6nNj)

Using **UFT** though, we define intertia as the interaction between a current radiated field, and the next
one generated as the object moves. More detail here: [README-fascinating-hypothesis.md](https://t2m.io/iiFMKkO)

### Mass

**UFT** defines mass. More detail here: [README-define-mass.md](https://t2m.io/e9RAVQW)

### Atomic Cohesion

**UFT** explains atomic cohesion. More detail here: [README-snow-plow-analogy.md](https://t2m.io/2t0iUHY)

### Electrostatic and Magnetic Forces

**UFT** explains electrostatic and magnetic forces. More detail here: [README-electrostatic-and-magnetic.md](https://t2m.io/BTMt6eW)

### Warping SpaceTime

**UFT** Speaks to the warpingof SpaceTime. More details here: [README-space-time.md](https://t2m.io/zjVrZAT)

### Dark Matter

**UFT** sees dark matter as bits trying to become stable, but they mostly fail. More detail here: [README-dark-matter.md](https://t2m.io/dqht6sN)

### Quantum Entanglement

Classical quantum entanglement properties detailed here: [README-spooky-action.md](https://t2m.io/neagq7w)

**UFT** explains quantum entanglement. More detail here: [README-spooky-action-at-a-distance.md](https://t2m.io/i2Z6eqU) and here: [README-more-on-entanglement.md](https://t2m.io/mPQY3vd)

## Radioactive Decay

Classically, radioactive decay is detailed here: [README-decay.md](https://t2m.io/2oUoGUf)

**UFT** sees it somewhat differently. More details here: [README-decay-uft.md](https://t2m.io/ZMTFqh9)

### Bose–Einstein Condensate

**UFT** explains Bose-Einstein condensate. More detail here: [README-zero-k.md](https://t2m.io/JQCJn6p)

### Black Holes

Black holes do radiate heat. More detain here: [README-black-hole-heat.md](https://t2m.io/K3ybx2d)

**UFT** discusses black holes. More detains here: [README-more-on-black-holes.md](https://t2m.io/UL2rHD5)

## Derivations

**UFT** derives fundamentals such as:

- Derive $F = m \cdot a$ [See Derivation](https://t2m.io/i1SNwFO)
- Derive $F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ [See Derivaton](https://t2m.io/qifOSa0)
